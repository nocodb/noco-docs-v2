## **Table & Field Permissions** : Control access‚Äîexactly how you need it

> Give the right people the right level of access. With granular table and field permissions, you decide who can create, edit or delete data‚Äîkeeping sensitive information protected and workflows clean.

[Learn more](https://nocodb.com/docs/product-docs/roles-and-permissions/table-permissions)

Whether you're managing customer data, financial records, or team operations, controlling access is critical. **Table & Field Permissions** let you define who can create or delete records in a table, and who can edit values in specific fields‚Äîso every user interacts only with the data they‚Äôre meant to.

This feature helps enforce data discipline without slowing down collaboration. Need to prevent accidental changes to calculated fields? Lock them down. Trying to keep draft records protected until approved? Limit creation and deletion rights at the table level.

With precise controls at your fingertips, you reduce the risk of errors, simplify team roles, and ensure everyone stays focused on what matters. Whether you're working with internal stakeholders, clients, or cross-functional teams, you can shape the right experience for each user.

## **Record colouring** : Turn data into insight‚Äîinstantly!


> Brings instant visual clarity to your tables‚Äîhighlight key data using custom rules or field values. Spot **trends**, flag **priorities**, and take action faster with colours that make your data speak.

[Learn more](https://nocodb.com/docs/product-docs/table-operations/record-colouring)

Whether you're tracking project statuses, managing sales pipelines, reviewing creative assets, or monitoring financial thresholds, **Record Colouring** helps you instantly surface what matters‚Äîwithout changing your data or layout. By visually highlighting records based on field values or custom conditions, you can spot trends, flag issues, and act faster‚Äîall within the views you already use.


Apply customisable colours to records across Grid, Gallery, Kanban and Calendar views, making it easier to **spot, group and act** on key items. By mapping colours to single-select field options or to user-defined conditions‚Äîsuch as high-priority tasks, overdue invoices or specific risk levels‚Äîyou **gain** **faster visual insights, clearer categorisation and fewer oversights**.

* **Operations**: Mark records needing review or flag data issues instantly


Each view can have its own colouring criteria, so you maintain flexibility across different perspectives without affecting other team members‚Äô views. For step-by-step guidance on setting up and managing record colouring, see the documentation [here](https://nocodb.com/docs/product-docs/table-operations/record-colouring).

## **Webhook v3** : Smarter triggers, cleaner automation]


> Streamline your integrations with unified events, richer payloads, and flexible trigger options. Webhook v3 gives you precise control over when and how data changes are pushed to external systems‚Äîno extra overhead, no missed updates.

[Learn more](https://nocodb.com/docs/product-docs/automation/webhook)

Webhook v3 simplifies how events are structured by **consolidating single and bulk operations** into unified event types: `after insert`, `after update`, and `after delete`.

The **bulk insert payload** now contains the actual inserted records (not just a count).


We‚Äôve also added two powerful configuration options:

* **Send Everything** ‚Äì A single configuration to capture all record changes (Insert, Update, and Delete) within a table. Alternatively, you can choose specific combinations of events‚Äîsuch as Insert & Delete ‚Äîbased on your needs. There's no longer a need to create separate webhook‚Äôs for each event type.
* **Field-level triggers** ‚Äì fire webhook‚Äôs only when specific fields (like `Status` or `Priority`) change.


*Field level triggers are available only on self-hosted enterprise edition and NocoDB cloud plans.*


Existing webhook will remain functional. To make adoption easy, existing Webhook (v2) configurations can be upgraded via the UI with just a few clicks. You‚Äôll see a side-by-side comparison before confirming the switch.

## **API v3** (beta) : Fewer calls, cleaner design


> Build faster with a consistent, RESTful API that returns richer relation data, supports in-place record linking, and offers predictable, project-scoped endpoints‚Äîmaking integrations simpler and more efficient.

[Learn more](https://data-apis-v3.nocodb.com/)

#### **Highlights:**


1. **Embedded Relation Field Data**
    * **v2:** When you listed records, relation fields returned only a count of linked records.
    * **v3:** The same endpoint now returns the full list of paginated linked records inline, so you can fetch related details in a single call‚Äîno more chasing separate endpoints.
2. **Unified Record Linking in CRUD Operations**
    * **v2:** Creating or updating a record with links required you to call dedicated ‚Äúlink‚Äù or ‚Äúunlink‚Äù endpoints after using associated create / update record APIs.
    * **v3:** You can now create or modify record links directly within the `create record` and `update record` APIs. This means linking related records happens as part of your standard CRUD request.
3. **Standardised Responses & Errors** Predictable envelopes and status codes simplify client-side parsing and error handling. Field type handling is now more consistent across create and update APIs, reducing ambiguity and integration effort.



#### **Benefits**

* **Reduced API Traffic:** Inline relation data and combined link operations mean fewer HTTP requests and lower latency.
* **Simplified Workflows:** Fetch records plus their relations, or create records with links, in one go‚Äîno orchestration required.
