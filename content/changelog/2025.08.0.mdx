# **Enhanced API Support**: Manage collaborators & views with more flexibility

> NocoDB‚Äôs API layer is now more powerful. You can programmatically manage **workspace & base member collaboration** and perform full **CRUD operations on views**‚Äîacross Grid, Gallery, Canvas, and Kanban.

This opens up new automation and integration workflows, giving developers fine-grained control over how teams collaborate and how data is presented.

**What‚Äôs new:**

* **Workspace & Base Members**: Add, update, or remove collaborators via API
* **Views**: Create, read, update, and delete Grid, Gallery, Canvas, and Kanban views

These enhancements make it easier to integrate NocoDB with external systems, automate team onboarding, or build custom apps powered by NocoDB data.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Support for **Form view CRUD APIs** will be added soon.

Learn more about new set of APIs in the API documentation here: [Views](https://nocodb.com/apis/v3/meta#tag/Views), [Workspace members](https://nocodb.com/apis/v3/meta#tag/Workspace-Members), [Base members](https://nocodb.com/apis/v3/meta#tag/Base-Members)



# Other changes

* **Fullscreen Mode** A new toolbar button lets you expand any view area to fullscreen. This hides navigation menus and other interface elements, helping you focus entirely on your data. Learn more in the documentation here.

* **Authorization Header Support**
Support for the standard `Authorization` header with Bearer token format has been introduced. This can be used as an alternative to the existing `xc-token` header for API authentication.

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_token_here"
  }
}
```

* **Script Trigger from Buttons** Execute a custom script directly from a button field. Scripts can perform operations on the current record or the entire table. The current record‚Äôs details can be accessed using the **row** variable in the script. Learn more in the documentation here.


* **Webhook Trigger on Specific Form Submission** Configure webhooks to trigger only when a specific form is submitted, enabling precise automation workflows and integrations.  Learn more in the documentation here.
