# Realtime Collaboration:

> Work together without missing a beat. With Realtime Canvas Grid, every change made to your data is instantly reflected for all collaborators‚Äîno refresh needed.

Few months ago, we introduced the first ever canvas based grid on a no-code database rivaling google spreadsheet. Now, we are layering realtime collaboration layer on top of it. Updates to records, fields, and layouts appear immediately, so everyone sees the latest version of the data as it happens. No more waiting to reload the page.

**Example use cases**

* **Project Management**: Teammates update task owners and statuses simultaneously without collisions
* **Sales Teams**: Ensure pipeline data is always up-to-date during meetings
* **Operations**: Track changing order or inventory information in real time
* **Product Teams**: Monitor bug reports and feature statuses as they are updated live

Realtime Canvas Grid keeps your entire team aligned, reduces duplicate effort, and turns NocoDB into a truly collaborative workspace.


*Realtime Canvas Grid is available now across all paid* *plans in Cloud and Enterprise.*

# Trigger Scripts From Button:

> Streamline repetitive workflows with buttons that run custom scripts directly on your data.

**We've supercharged our Button field capabilities.** While buttons could previously open custom URLs or invoke external APIs, we've now taken this functionality to the next level with direct script execution. This powerful upgrade transforms buttons for not just external automation triggers but for more extensive internal automations too.

The current record's details are automatically available through the `cursor` variable, giving you direct access to its fields inside your script.

**Example use cases**

* **Task Management**: Mark a task as complete or update its status instantly
* **Notifications**: Trigger an email, Slack message, or webhook when a button is pressed
* **Data Operations**: Apply transformations or calculations to one or multiple records

Button Triggered Scripts bring automation directly into your tables, reducing manual steps and making workflows more interactive. Learn more [here](/docs/product-docs/fields/field-types/custom-types/button)

# User Management API Support:

> NocoDB‚Äôs API layer is now more powerful. You can programmatically manage **workspace & base member collaboration** and perform full **CRUD operations on views**‚Äîacross Grid, Gallery, Canvas, and Kanban.

This opens up new automation and integration workflows, giving developers fine-grained control over how teams collaborate and how data is presented.

**What‚Äôs new:**

* **Workspace & Base Members**: Add, update, or remove collaborators via API
* **Views**: Create, read, update, and delete Grid, Gallery, Canvas, and Kanban views

These enhancements make it easier to integrate NocoDB with external systems, automate team onboarding, or build custom apps powered by NocoDB data.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Support for **Form view CRUD APIs** will be added soon.

Learn more about new set of APIs in the API documentation here: [Views](https://nocodb.com/apis/v3/meta#tag/Views), [Workspace members](https://nocodb.com/apis/v3/meta#tag/Workspace-Members), [Base members](https://nocodb.com/apis/v3/meta#tag/Base-Members)



# Other Changes

* **Fullscreen Mode** A new toolbar button lets you expand any view area to fullscreen. This hides navigation menus and other interface elements, helping you focus entirely on your data. Learn more in the documentation [here](/docs/product-docs/table-operations/full-screen).

* **Authorization Header Support**
Support for the standard `Authorization` header with Bearer token format has been introduced. This can be used as an alternative to the existing `xc-token` header for API authentication. Learn more [here](https://nocodb.com/docs/product-docs/account-settings/api-tokens)

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_token_here"
  }
}
```

* Ability to [disable the support chat system](https://nocodb.com/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables#support-chat) within the on-premise enterprise version.


* **Webhook Trigger on Specific Form Submission** Configure webhooks to trigger only when a specific form is submitted, enabling precise automation workflows and integrations.  Learn more in the documentation [here](/docs/product-docs/automation/webhook/create-webhook#webhook-on-specific-form-submission-).
