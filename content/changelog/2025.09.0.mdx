## MCP Server : Connect NocoDB with AI assistants

> *Example query : Show me all customers who haven't paid their invoices in the last 30 days*

**That's it. No clicking through filters. No navigating views. No remembering which dropdown has what option. Just ask your AI assistant in Claude and get instant results from your NocoDB database.**

NocoDB users know this pain: you're building something amazing with your no-code database, but every time you need specific data, you're clicking through endless UI elements, setting up filters, switching between views, and losing your flow. What if your database could just answer when you ask?

**Introducing MCP Server for NocoDB** : We're releasing Model Context Protocol (MCP) with NocoDB, bringing your no-code database directly into AI-powered tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf. Now your data is as accessible as having a conversation.

**From This Reality:**


1. Navigate to the right table
2. Set up multiple filters
3. Sort and configure view
4. Scroll through results
5. Export or copy data
6. Switch back to your work
7. Repeat for the next query

**To This:** "Find all users who signed up this week and show their subscription status"

**Other example use cases**

* **Instant insights**: "Show me the last 10 support tickets with customer details"
* **Data analysis**: "How many new leads did we get each day this month?"
* **Bulk operations**: "Update all pending orders from last week to processing"
* **Quick cleanup**: "Find duplicate customer records and show their details"

Works with only **Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf desktop clients**. Your existing NocoDB workspace connects seamlessly - no setup required.

**This Is Just The Beginning :** Consider this your first taste of NocoDB's MCP magic. Much bigger things are just around the corner.

## Field & View Webhooks: Schema-level triggers for your database

> If your database structure changed. All stakeholders should know about it instantly.

Previously, NocoDB webhooks allowed **record-level change events**. Now, any structural changes to table or view —like adding a new field, renaming a view, or deleting a field—can trigger webhooks in real time.
![Field & View Webhooks](/img/changelog/20250900/view-webhook.png)

**Example use cases**

* **Product Management**: Notify downstream systems when a new column is added or updated in a table.
* **Reporting & Analytics**: Trigger dashboard refreshes or ETL pipelines whenever a view is modified.
* **Operations**: Automate cleanup tasks when fields are removed or renamed.
* **Team Notifications**: Send alerts via Slack, Discord, or email when key fields or views are updated.

These schema-level webhooks complement **record-level triggers** and manual button triggers, giving you full control over your database automation.

**Available triggers**

| **Trigger Source** | **Trigger Event**              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Field              | After Create / Update / Delete |
| View               | After Create / Update / Delete |


*Field & View webhooks are available now on **Cloud and self-hosted Enterprise plans.***

## Other updates

* **Dashboards and Tables Now in One Place**
We've combined Dashboards and Tables into a single sidebar section. Instead of switching between separate sections, you'll now find all your dashboards and tables together in one place. This means fewer clicks, faster navigation, and easier access to related content when working on your data.
* **Only IDs based view URLs made it hard to navigate to them in browser:** Your browser remembers full URLs for frequently visited tables and views, but the URLs only contained cryptic IDs instead of readable names. Now all view URLs include the table and view name, making it easy to type `top leads` in your browser to quickly navigate to views containing "top leads" in the table or column name.

* **File uploads needed a lot clicks:** Adding attachments required multiple clicks and navigation steps. Now attachments can be dragged and dropped directly into attachment cells, making file uploads faster and more intuitive.
* **Group states would reset when switching views:** Previously expanded groups would automatically collapse when you switched between views, forcing you to re-expand them repeatedly. Now group state (expanded/collapsed) is maintained locally per view, preserving your organization preferences.
* **No easy way to copy Base IDs for API usage:** Developers needed Base IDs for API integration but had no quick way to access them. Added **Base ID copy** functionality to the base menu, following the same pattern as table, view, and field ID copying—providing quick access for API usage.
* **Mobile view editor was difficult to use:** Mobile operations in form view has been improved, ensuring a better usage experience across all devices.
* **German users couldn't use local date formats:** The system didn't support standard German date conventions. Added German Date Format Support for `DD.MM.YYYY` and `DD.MM.YY`, enabling proper display and input of dates in local conventions.
* **DATEADD formula was limited to days only:** Time-based calculations requiring hours, minutes, or seconds weren't possible. Enhanced DATEADD formula now supports adding hours, minutes, and seconds, enabling more precise date-time calculations.
* **Dashboard iFrames had limited external domain support:** Many useful external tools couldn't be embedded in dashboards. Expanded iFrame whitelist for dashboards now supports more external domains for greater integration flexibility. ([Refer to NC_IFRAME_WHITELIST_DOMAINS](/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables))
