## New Features

### Filter by Current User

We've introduced a new filter for the field 'User' type that allows you to filter by the 'Current user' who is currently viewing the table/view. This eliminates the need to manually update filters when different users access the same view. Perfect for creating personalised views, task management systems, and collaborative workspaces where users need to see only their own records.

### Two New Expanded Record Modes

Introducing two specialised record view modes designed for modern data collaboration. **File Preview Mode** displays attachments front and centre, with support for PDFs, images, audio, and video files‚Äîperfect for managing visual content and documents. **Discussion Mode** centralises all comments and threads related to a record, enabling seamless team collaboration and context-rich conversations. Both modes complement the existing **Field Mode**, allowing users to switch between structured data entry, visual file inspection, and collaborative discussions based on their specific workflow needs.
