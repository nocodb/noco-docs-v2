## Connect ChatGPT and Claude to NocoDB with OAuth

All of  your favorite AI assistants just got a massive upgrade. **ChatGPT and Claude can now DIRECTLY connect to your NocoDB databases** directly through our new MCP OAuth integration - no technical setup required. But that's just the beginning: **any AI application that supports MCP OAuth connectors** can instantly access your NocoDB data with a simple authentication flow.

#### What This Means for You

**Before:** Limited to desktop apps & technical barrier

* **Fiddling with MCP Server endpoint JSON configurations** - completely unfriendly for business users
* **Limited to desktop AI applications only** - Even ChatGPT and Claude web/mobile apps couldn't connect
* Required developer expertise to set up and IT team was a bottleneck.

**After:** One-Click Universal Access

* **Simple OAuth flow** - just like connecting via Slack/Google/Facebook
* **Works everywhere** - web, mobile, desktop across all ChatGPT and Claude interfaces
* **Business-user friendly** - no JSON, no servers, no technical knowledge required
* **10-second setup** from any device, anywhere
* **Any MCP OAuth-enabled AI app** can connect instantly

How NocoDB MCP Oauth works ?

The OAuth integration allows web-based AI clients to request fine-grained access to your NocoDB workspace. Once authorised, these clients can securely query, summarise, and update your database contextually — just like their desktop counterparts.

## Copy Another View’s Configuration

> I just adjusted field widths in one view, and now I have to manually resize them all over again in every other view.

You've perfected a view with specific filters, sorts, groups, and field layouts. Now you need a similar view for a different purpose. You either duplicate the entire view and strip away what you don't need, or manually recreate every configuration from scratch. Either way, you're repeating work you've already done.

Introducing **“Copy another view’s configuration”**. Now you can cherry-pick exactly what you need. Need those filters? Copy them. Love the sorting and grouping? Take just those. Your field widths are perfect? Import only that—no more manual resizing.

Reuse exactly what you need and move forward instantly. Your views now build on each other instead of starting from scratch every time.
