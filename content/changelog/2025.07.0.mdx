## **Dashboards**: Visualise your data, share insights, and drive decisions.

> Turn your table data into rich, visual insights. With Dashboards, you can track metrics, share performance updates, and help your team make data-driven decisionsâ€”all without leaving NocoDB.

Whether you're reporting on project progress, tracking business KPIs, or sharing insights with stakeholders, Dashboards bring visual clarity to your data. Add **Number Widgets** for key metrics or **Pie & Donut Charts** to break down category dataâ€”each widget is fully customisable and easy to configure.

Use filters, sort settings, and number formatting to control how your data appears. Resize, reposition, and personalise your layout with drag-and-drop ease. When you're ready to share, create public links or password-protected dashboards that anyone can viewâ€”no login needed.

Dashboards empower your team to stay aligned, spot trends, and act quickly. Whether you're building reports for executives, summaries for clients, or real-time views for your team, Dashboards turn raw data into clear, actionable insights.


![dashboard](/img/changelog/20250700/dashboard.png " =1920x1080")


**Example use cases**

* **Executive Reporting**: Show high-level KPIs in a single view with Number Widgets
* **Sales & Marketing**: Share campaign performance with external partners via public links
* **Operations**: Track real-time workflows or status metrics across departments
* **Finance**: Visualise budget distribution using Pie Charts
* **Product Teams**: Monitor feature adoption metrics or bug status summaries

*Dashboards (currently in **Beta**) are now available on NocoDB Cloud **Plus** plan onwards.*

Dashboards are easy to set up, flexible to use, and built to scale with your needs. Learn how to create your first dashboard in our [documentation here](https://nocodb.com/docs/product-docs/dashboards).

## **Private Base**: Control over who sees what.

> Keep sensitive data private and in the right hands. With Private Base, you decide exactly who can access each baseâ€”no more automatic access through workspace roles.

By default, all bases in a workspace inherit access from workspace roles. That means Editors and Viewers could access every new baseâ€”even when it wasnâ€™t meant for them. **Private Base** changes that.

A **Private Base** breaks free from workspace-wide role inheritance. Only the base creator has access by default. Everyone else must be explicitly invited with a base-specific roleâ€”giving you full control.


![private base](/img/changelog/20250700/private-base.png " =1920x1080")

**Example use cases**

* **HR or Finance**: Keep salary data or budget sheets visible only to the right people
* **Leadership**: Share strategy documents or planning dashboards with execs only
* **Draft Workspaces**: Prepare content or data without exposing it to the wider team
* **External Workspaces**: Hide select client bases from other clients or external partners


***Private Base*** *is available starting with the NocoDB **Business** plan and in self-hosted **Enterprise** plans. Please note that this feature is **not** included in the self-hosted **Enterprise Starter** plan.*

## **New Extensions**: Bulk Update & Page Designer

> Two powerful new extensions are hereâ€”**Bulk Update** for fast multi-record edits, and **Page Designer** to turn your data into shareable, printable documents.


Whether you're managing large datasets or building client-facing reports, these two extensions help streamline your workflow inside NocoDB. **Bulk Update** saves time by letting you update many records at once. **Page Designer** helps you create branded PDFsâ€”like invoices, reports, and certificatesâ€”directly from your data.


---

### Bulk Update â€” Update multiple records instantly

Manually editing rows one at a time? Bulk Update lets you apply field-level changes to **all records in a table view** with just a few clicks. You can configure multiple update actions, review changes before applying, and reuse saved actions whenever needed.

**Perfect for:**

* Cleaning up outdated fields
* Applying status or tag changes to filtered sets

## **Script Steps**: Structure your script into clear, logical sections

> Make complex scripts easier to follow by grouping related actions into meaningful steps.

With Script Steps, you can organise your script into well-defined blocksâ€”each with a title, icon, colour, and optional message. This helps users (and developers) better understand what's happening during execution without getting lost in the details.


<img src="/img/changelog/20250700/script-step.png" alt="script steps" width="480"/>


**Benefits**

* Break down large scripts into understandable sections
* Add optional context messages (e.g. count, status, totals)
* Use icons and colours for visual clarity
* Improve maintainability and user confidence

## Other changes

### Conditional Lookup & Rollup â€” Filter linked records with precision

Both **Lookup** and **Rollup** fields now support filters to include **only linked records that meet specific conditions**. Instead of pulling in all related data, you can define criteria to show or calculate values based on what's most relevant.

This helps tailor your data views and summariesâ€”whether you want to display only active records or aggregate values for a specific subset.


<img src="/img/changelog/20250700/lookup-filter.png" alt="lookup filter" width="480" />


**Use cases:**

* Show only completed tasks in a Lookup
* Sum revenue from the current month in a Rollup
* Count records that meet a numeric or status threshold

This gives you fine-grained control over the data that's displayed or aggregatedâ€”making your tables smarter and more focused. Learn more about how to use this feature in our [Conditional Lookup](https://nocodb.com/docs/product-docs/fields/field-types/links-based/lookup#conditional-lookup) and [Conditional Rollup](https://nocodb.com/docs/product-docs/fields/field-types/links-based/rollup#conditional-rollup) documentation.


### Group By Views â€” Expand or Collapse All

You can now **Expand All** or **Collapse All** groups in Group By views with a single clickâ€”making it easier to explore or condense grouped records.

This is especially helpful when dealing with large datasets or when presenting grouped summaries to your team.
