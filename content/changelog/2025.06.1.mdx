# 🚀 Introducing NocoAI — Smarter apps, Built Instantly

We’re thrilled to unveil **NocoAI**, our first step toward bringing intelligent automation and AI-powered building blocks to NocoDB. Whether you're starting from scratch or scaling up complex databases, NocoAI is here to help you move faster — with less guesswork and more confidence.

From schema generation to contextual recommendations, NocoAI simplifies the way you build and evolve your workspaces.

## 🧠 What’s Included in NocoAI’s First Iteration

### 🔧 1. **Prompt-Based Schema Generation**

Setting up a new workspace has never been easier. With NocoAI, you can simply describe what you're trying to build in natural language, and it will instantly generate a complete base structure for you. This includes tables, fields with appropriate types, relationships between tables, and even starter views to get you going. Whether you're a startup founder with a product idea, a team lead setting up a new workflow, or just someone looking to organize information, NocoAI saves you the hours you would typically spend planning and configuring your schema.

> **Example:** *“I want to track marketing campaigns with budget, channel, timeline, and performance.”* → NocoAI generates a fully structured base with relevant tables and views instantly.

### 🧱 2. **Smart Table Recommendations**

As you build your base, NocoAI doesn’t just stop at initial setup — it actively helps you expand. By analyzing your current schema, it can recommend additional tables that naturally complement your existing structure. This ensures that you don’t miss out on important data relationships and helps guide you toward normalized, scalable designs.

> **Example:** Have a “Projects” table? NocoAI may suggest adding a “Clients” or “Invoices” table.

These recommendations are grounded in common patterns and best practices, helping you model your data like a pro.

### 🧩 3. **Context-Aware Field Recommendations**

Inside each table, NocoAI acts like a smart assistant that understands your data model and suggests what you might need next. It looks at the table name, existing fields, and typical usage scenarios to recommend additional fields that enhance your tracking and automation capabilities.

> **Example:** On a “Tasks” table, it might suggest fields like “Priority”, “Estimated Hours”, or “Due Date”.

This makes your data richer and more actionable, especially for users who may not be familiar with designing comprehensive schemas from scratch.

### 🪟 4. **View Recommendations**

Creating meaningful views of your data is crucial for collaboration and insight. NocoAI steps in here as well, recommending appropriate views based on the table’s structure and purpose. Whether it’s a Grid view for raw data entry, a Kanban view for pipeline tracking, a Calendar view for date-driven workflows, or custom filtered views for specific segments, NocoAI ensures you’re always looking at your data the right way.

> **Example:** For a “Leads” table, NocoAI might recommend a Kanban view grouped by status.

These recommendations save setup time and improve the usability of your base across teams.

### 🎯 5. **Select Options Recommendations**

Creating select fields can be tedious when you have to think through and manually enter every option. With NocoAI, that step is handled intelligently. When you name a field like “Priority” or “Status,” it can immediately generate a set of relevant options such as Low, Medium, High, or Not Started, In Progress, Completed. This not only saves time but also ensures greater consistency across your data, especially in team environments where standardized options matter. The suggestions are contextually aware and based on familiar patterns used across thousands of bases.

> **Example:** Naming a field “Status”? Get suggestions like “Not Started”, “In Progress”, “Completed”.

### 🧮 6. **Prompt-Based Formula Generation**

Writing formulas can be daunting, especially for users unfamiliar with syntax or function libraries. NocoAI removes that barrier by letting you describe what you want in plain English and turning that into a working formula instantly. Whether it’s calculating date differences, conditional logic, string manipulations, or complex nested expressions, NocoAI does the heavy lifting.

> **Example:** *“Calculate the number of days between start and end date”* → Generates: `DATETIME_DIFF({End Date}, {Start Date}, 'days')`

<img src="/img/changelog/20250601-5.png" alt="Image" style={{ width: '60%', maxWidth: '600px' }} />

This opens up powerful automation and computed fields to everyone — not just the technically inclined.
