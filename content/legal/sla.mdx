**Last Updated: August 05, 2025**

NocoDB provides a 99.9% uptime commitment for active customers on our Enterprise plans (and certain Business plan customers who have agreed to NocoDB’s [Master Subscription Agreement](/docs/legal/msa)), subject to the terms below.

To review current and historical uptime, visit our [Status Page](https://status.nocodb.com/).

## Uptime Commitment
NocoDB will provide Uptime equal to at least 99.9% of the total time in each calendar month, as measured by NocoDB (the “Uptime Commitment”). “Uptime” means the total time, in minutes, during the relevant calendar month less the Downtime during that calendar month. We measure Uptime using server monitoring software, which monitors, among other things, server-side success and error rates, client-side success and error rates, and the overall volume of server requests (including both requests from NocoDB's clients and public API requests).

## Downtime
“Downtime” means the time, in minutes, that the applicable Services are not generally accessible and available, excluding inaccessibility or unavailability due to (a) the Customer’s or the Customer’s Permitted Users’ acts or omissions, (b) the Customer’s or the Customer’s Permitted Users’ and/or third-party equipment, software, or other technology (other than third-party equipment within NocoDB’s direct control), (c) the Customer’s or the Customer’s Permitted User-supplied integrations or API customizations that interfere with the operation of the Services, (d) slowness or other performance issues with NocoDB Product features, (e) Internet outages, or computer or telecommunications failures or delays, (f) Force Majeure Events, (g) scheduled maintenance disclosed with at least 24 hours’ notice, (h) hacking or virus attacks, or (i) reasonable emergency maintenance, or (j) issues arising from the use of experimental, beta, or early access features not officially released for general availability.

## Service Credits
If the Uptime Commitment is not met during any particular calendar month during the Service Term, then Enterprise plan Customers will be eligible for a service credit (“Service Credit”) equal to ten (10) times the fees paid from the applicable Customer to NocoDB for the affected Services for the portion of the calendar month that constituted Downtime (calculated by dividing Downtime by the total number of minutes in the calendar month), provided that the Customer reports to NocoDB such failure to meet the Uptime Commitment and requests such Service Credit in accordance with this Service Level Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, fees paid by the Customer shall be allocated on a per-minute basis over the calendar month for which they were paid.

To request a Service Credit, Customers must send an email to NocoDB at support@nocodb.com within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the Uptime Commitment was not met. The Customer must include either its account ID or registered email address, and the previously reported dates and times when there was Downtime.

If NocoDB confirms that a Customer is eligible for a Service Credit, NocoDB will issue a credit to the Customer’s account within thirty (30) days. Service Credits are not refunds, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, and may only be used against future billing charges. The Service Credits shall be the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and NocoDB’s sole and exclusive liability, for any failure by NocoDB to meet the Uptime Commitment.

## Definitions
Any capitalized terms not defined in this Service Level Agreement have the meanings given to them in NocoDB’s [Master Subscription Agreement](/docs/legal/msa) (the "MSA"). References to the “Services” in this Service Level Agreement also mean the “NocoDB Products” (or similar term), as used in the MSA.

## Updates
As NocoDB evolves, we may change our Service Level Agreement, so we encourage you to regularly check this page for updates.
