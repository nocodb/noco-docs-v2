**Workflows** in NocoDB enable you to automate repetitive tasks and streamline your processes. By setting up workflows, you can trigger actions based on specific events or conditions within your base. Each automation starts with a trigger and executes one or more actions, optionally controlled by flow logic such as if / else condition or an iteration.

<Callout type="note">Workflows are currently in **beta** release & are available on NocoDB Cloud and on-premise licensed deployments.</Callout>

![Example flow](/img/v2/workflow/example-1.png)

A workflow consists of the following building blocks:

1. **Trigger node** – Defines `when` the automation runs
2. **Action nodes** – Defines `what` happens when the automation runs
3. **Flow nodes** – Defines `how` actions are executed (conditional logic, iteration)

## Trigger Node

A **Trigger** determines when an automation starts. Each automation must have exactly one trigger.


### When manually triggered

Runs the automation only when triggered manually by a user.
Useful for testing workflows or running one-off operations.


### At scheduled time

Runs the automation on a fixed schedule.

**Use cases**

* Daily or weekly reports
* Periodic data cleanup
* Scheduled reminders


### When record created

Triggers when a new record is added to a selected table.

**Use cases**

* Send notifications for new entries
* Auto-create related records
* Initialize default values


### When record updated

Triggers when an existing record is modified.

**Use cases**

* React to status changes
* Sync updates across tables
* Notify stakeholders on field changes


### When record deleted

Triggers when a record is removed from a table.

**Use cases**

* Cleanup dependent records
* Log deletions
* Notify administrators


### When form submitted

Triggers when a form view connected to a table is submitted.

**Use cases**

* Lead capture workflows
* Support request handling
* Survey response processing


### When record enters a view

Triggers when a record appears in a specific view for the first time. The view’s filters define the trigger condition.

**Use cases**

* Workflow stages
* Approval pipelines
* Task readiness detection


### When record matches conditions

Triggers when a record meets defined conditions. The conditions can be based on any field values in the record.

**Use cases**

* Rule-based automations
* SLA breaches
* Conditional alerts


## Action Nodes

Actions define what the automation does after the trigger fires. Multiple actions can be chained together. Actions execute sequentially in the order they are connected.


### Record Actions

#### Create record

Creates a new record in a specified table. The fields of the new record can be set using static values or data from previous actions.

**Use cases**

* Create follow-up tasks
* Insert audit logs
* Sync data across tables


#### Update record

Updates one or more fields in an existing record. The fields to update can be set using static values or data from previous actions.

**Use cases**

* Change status fields
* Set computed values
* Mark records as processed


#### Find record

Finds a single record matching specified criteria. The found record or its ID can be used in subsequent actions.

**Use cases**

* Locate related records
* Fetch data for later actions

#### List records

Retrieves multiple records that match defined filters. The resulting list can be used in flow nodes like **Iterate**.

**Use cases**

* Batch operations
* Iteration using flow nodes


#### Delete record

Deletes a record from a table. ID of the record to delete can be specified using static values or data from previous actions.

**Use cases**

* Data cleanup
* Lifecycle enforcement


## Communication Actions

### Send an email

Sends an email using configured email settings.

**Use cases**

* Notifications
* Alerts
* User confirmations


### Send message

Sends a message to an external messaging service (for example, Slack).

**Use cases**

* Team notifications
* Operational alerts
* Workflow updates


## Flow Nodes

Flow nodes control how actions are executed within an automation. They enable conditional branching and iteration over records.


### If / else

Adds conditional branching to the workflow. Based on the evaluation of a condition, it directs execution to either the **If** branch or the **Else** branch. The condition can be based on data from previous actions.

**Behavior**

* Evaluates a condition
* Executes actions in the **If** branch when condition is true
* Executes actions in the **Else** branch when condition is false

**Use cases**

* Approval logic
* Conditional notifications
* Business rule enforcement


### Iterate

Repeats a set of actions for each item in specified list data (for example, records from **List records** action).

**Behavior**

* Accepts array output from previous action
* Executes child actions once per array item

**Use cases**

* Bulk updates
* Batch notifications
* Record-by-record processing


## Execution Order

1. Trigger fires
2. Actions execute top-to-bottom
3. Flow nodes control branching or repetition
4. Automation completes once all paths finish execution
5. Logs are recorded for auditing
