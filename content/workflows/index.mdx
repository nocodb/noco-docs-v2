## Overview

NocoDB **Workflows** enable you to automate processes by connecting triggers and actions in a visual, no-code interface. Workflows help you react to data changes, schedule tasks, and orchestrate multi-step operations across your NocoDB bases and external systems — without writing custom code.

Workflows are ideal for building repeatable business processes such as notifications, approvals, data synchronization, and periodic maintenance.

<Callout type="info">Workflows are available from the NocoDB Plus plan on the cloud, and with the Enterprise license in self-hosted environments.</Callout>

## Key Features

* **Visual Automation Builder**: Design workflows using trigger and action nodes
* **Event-Based Triggers**: Run workflows based on record events or schedules
* **Multi-Step Actions**: Chain multiple actions with clear execution order
* **Conditional Logic**: Control execution flow using conditions and filters
* **Database Operations**: Create, update, delete, and query records
* **Audit Trails**: Track workflow executions and outcomes
* **Error Visibility**: Monitor execution status and troubleshoot failures

## Getting Started

To create your first workflow:

1. Click on **+ Create New** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Workflow** from the dropdown menu
3. Enter a name and description to define the purpose of the workflow
4. Add a **Trigger** node to determine when the workflow starts
5. Connect one or more **Action** nodes to define what happens next
6. Save and enable the workflow to make it active

## Workflow Structure

A typical NocoDB workflow consists of:

### Trigger

A **Trigger** defines when the workflow runs. Each workflow must have exactly one trigger.

Trigger types include:

* **When manually triggered**
* **At scheduled time**
* **On record create**
* **On record update**
* **On record delete**
* **On form submission**
* **On record match (conditions-based)**
* **ON record entering view**

### Actions

**Actions** define the operations performed after the trigger fires. Actions execute sequentially in the order they are connected.

Examples:

* Create, update or delete records
* Send emails
* Send notifications
* Call external APIs _< coming soon >_
* Run scripts _< coming soon >_

### Flow Control

Flow control nodes allow you to control execution flow by evaluating field values or runtime data before proceeding to the next action.

## Core Concepts

* **Workflow**: A container that defines automation logic
* **Trigger Node**: Starting point of the workflow
* **Action Node**: An operation executed as part of the workflow
* **Execution Context**: Runtime data passed between nodes
* **Sequential Execution**: Actions run in a defined order
* **Manual vs Automated Runs**: Support for both on-demand and event-based execution
* **Status & Logs**: Visibility into workflow runs and failures

## When to Use Workflows

Use workflows when you need to:

* Automate repetitive data operations
* React to changes in table records
* Schedule routine jobs
* Integrate NocoDB with external tools
* Enforce business processes consistently

For complex logic, custom data processing, or advanced integrations, workflows can be combined with **Scripts** to extend automation capabilities.
