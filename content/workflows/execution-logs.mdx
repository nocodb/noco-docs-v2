**Execution Logs** provide complete visibility into how a workflow runs in NocoDB. Every time a workflow is triggered, NocoDB records detailed execution data—making it easy to monitor progress, verify outcomes, and troubleshoot failures.

Execution logs help you understand **what triggered the workflow**, **how each node executed**, and **where issues occurred**, all in a single, structured view. This is especially useful when building complex workflows with multiple actions, integrations, or conditional logic.

## Accessing execution logs

To view workflow execution logs:

- Open the workflow
- In the top toolbar, click the **Logs** tab
- Select an execution run to inspect its details

Each run represents a single execution of the workflow, captured from trigger to completion.

## Log views

### Execution list
View all workflow runs along with their execution status and timestamps. This view helps you quickly identify successful runs, failures, and recent activity.

### Node execution details
Inspect execution details for each node in the workflow. Selecting a node displays its inputs, outputs, and execution status, making it easy to trace data flow and pinpoint errors.
