Triggers a workflow when a new record is added to a selected table via a specific form in the current base. Inserted record data is available in the workflow context for further processing.

### Configuration

- **Table**: Select table in which the form submits records
- **Form**: Select the specific form to monitor for new records

**Additional options**

To monitor all the records created in the table regardless of the form used, use the [Record created](./record-created) trigger node.

To monitor all the records that enter a specific view after creation, use the [Record enters view](./record-enters-view) trigger node.

### How it works

- Trigger fires immediately after record creation via the selected form

### Use cases
- Send notifications for new records submitted via a form
- Auto-create related records based on form submissions
- Initialize default values for records created through a form
