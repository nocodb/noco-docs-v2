### Scheduled trigger

The **Scheduled Trigger** runs a workflow automatically at defined intervals. It is ideal for tasks that need to occur regularly, regardless of data changes.


### Configuration

- **Interval**:
    - **Every specified minutes** : Run every X minutes (e.g., every 15 minutes)
    - **Every hour** : Run hourly at a specific minute (e.g., at minute 30)
    - **Every day** : Run daily at a specific time (e.g., at 2:00 AM)
    - **Every week** : Run weekly on a specific day and time (e.g., every Monday at 9:00 AM)
    - **Every month** : Run monthly on a specific date and time (e.g., on the 4th at 12:00 PM)
- **Time**: Execution time, defaults to browser timezone. Can be set to specific timezone.
- **Timezone**: Optional (defaults to browser timezone). Not applicable for "Every specified minutes" option.
