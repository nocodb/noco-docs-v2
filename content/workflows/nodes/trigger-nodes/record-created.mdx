Triggers a workflow when a new record is added to a selected table in current base. Record insertion can happen via forms, API, or direct table entry. Inserted record data is available in the workflow context for further processing.


### Configuration

- **Table**: Select table to monitor for new records

![Record Created Configuration](/img/v2/workflow/nodes/trigger/record-created.png)

**Additional options**
- To add a condition, use trigger [when record matches condition](./record-matches-condition) node.
- To filter records created via specific form, use trigger [when form submitted](./record-created-form) node.
- To monitor records that enter a specific view, use trigger [when record enters a view](./record-enters-view) node.


### How it works

- Trigger fires immediately after record creation (via form, API, or direct entry)
- Multiple records inserted together (batch) trigger separately for each record


### Use cases

- Send notifications for new records
- Auto-create related records
- Initialize default values
