Triggers a workflow when a record (created or updated) meets defined conditions in a selected table. This allows for automated actions based on specific data criteria being fulfilled. The matched record data is available in the workflow context for further processing.

### Configuration
- **Table**: Select the target table to monitor
- **Filter**: Define the criteria that records must meet to trigger the workflow. You can set multiple conditions using logical operators (AND/OR). You can also create filter-groups for complex conditions.

### How it works
- Trigger evaluates records against defined conditions
- Fires when a record meets all specified criteria
- Works for both newly created and updated records

### Use cases
- Send notifications for high-priority records
- Auto-assign tasks based on status or priority
- Update related records when specific conditions are met
