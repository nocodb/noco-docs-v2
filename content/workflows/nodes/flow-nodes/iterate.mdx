The **Iterate** node in NocoDB workflows allows you to loop through a list of items (array) and execute a set of actions for each item individually. This is particularly useful for processing multiple records or data entries in a batch.

### Configuration
- **List**: Specify the array of items you want to iterate over. This can be sourced from previous nodes in the workflow.

### How It Works
- Iterate node accepts an input array and processes each item sequentially.
- For every item in the array, the workflow runs the actions defined in the **For each item** branch, enabling item-level handling.
- Once the **For each item** branch has completed execution for all items, the workflow proceeds through the **After iterate** branch.


### Use cases
- Sending personalized emails to a list of contacts
- Updating multiple records in a database
- Generating reports for each item in a dataset
