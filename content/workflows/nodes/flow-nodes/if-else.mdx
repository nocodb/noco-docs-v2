The **If-else** node in NocoDB workflows allows you to create conditional branches based on specified criteria. This node evaluates a condition and directs the workflow to different paths depending on whether the condition is met (true) or not (false).

### Configuration
- **Conditions**: Define the criteria that will be evaluated. You can use one or more conditions combined with logical operators (AND/OR). You can also create filter-groups for complex conditions. The conditions can be based on data from previous nodes in the workflow.

### How it works
- The If-else node evaluates the defined conditions.
- If the conditions are met (true), the workflow follows the if "True" branch.
- If the conditions are not met (false), the workflow follows the if "False" branch.

### Use cases
- Send different notifications based on record status
- Update records differently based on specific criteria
- Route tasks to different teams based on priority levels
