In NocoDB workflows, **Flow Nodes** are essential components that help control the execution path of your workflows based on specific conditions or logic. These nodes allow you to create dynamic and responsive workflows that can adapt to different scenarios.

## Types of Flow Nodes
NocoDB offers two main types of Flow Nodes:

- **If / else**: This node evaluates a condition and directs the workflow to different branches based on whether the condition is true or false. It is useful for implementing decision-making logic in your workflows.
- **Iterator**: This node allows you to loop through a list of items (array), executing a set of actions for each item in the list. It is particularly useful for processing multiple records or data entries in a batch.
