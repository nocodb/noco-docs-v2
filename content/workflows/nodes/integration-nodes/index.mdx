In NocoDB workflows, **Integration Nodes** allow you to connect your workflows with external services and AI capabilities. These nodes extend workflows beyond database operations, enabling data generation, communication, and collaboration across tools — all within the same automation flow.

Integration nodes are typically used when you want to enrich data, generate content, or trigger actions in third-party systems based on events or data from previous nodes.

## Types of Integration Nodes

NocoDB provides the following Integration Nodes to support common automation and AI-driven use cases:

* **Generate with AI**:
Use AI to generate content or structured data based on inputs from previous nodes. This is useful for tasks like summarization, data enrichment, classification, or transforming free-form input into structured fields.

* **Slack**:
Send messages to Slack channels or users as part of your workflow. This is commonly used for notifications, alerts, or status updates triggered by workflow events.

* **Gmail**:
Send emails using Gmail integration. This node is useful for personalized communication, confirmations, or automated follow-ups using dynamic workflow data.

Integration Nodes help you build end-to-end workflows that combine data operations, AI intelligence, and external communication — enabling powerful, real-world automations in NocoDB.
