The **Gmail** integration node in NocoDB workflows enables you to send emails through a connected Gmail account. This node is ideal for personalized communication, confirmations, and automated follow-ups using workflow data.

### Configuration
- **Gmail Account**: Select the connected Gmail account used to send emails. Refer to [Integrations](/docs/product-docs/integrations/create-connection) for setup instructions. You will be required to add at least one Gmail integration to use this feature.
- **To**: Specify one or more recipient email addresses. Multiple addresses can be separated using commas.
- **Subject**: Define the email subject. Supports static text and dynamic values from the workflow context.
- **Message**: Compose the email body. You can insert dynamic fields from previous nodes.

### How it works
- When the workflow reaches the Gmail node, it composes the email using the configured subject and message.
- Dynamic values are resolved before sending.
- The email is sent via the selected Gmail account.
- The workflow continues execution after the email is sent.

### Use cases
- Send welcome or onboarding emails.
- Notify users about workflow-driven events or updates.
- Deliver personalized messages based on record data or AI-generated content.
