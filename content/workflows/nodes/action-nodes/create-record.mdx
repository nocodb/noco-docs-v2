The **Create Record** action node in NocoDB workflows allows you to create new records in a specified table as part of your automated processes. This node is essential for adding data dynamically based on the workflow's logic and inputs.

### Configuration
- **Table**: Select the target table where the new record will be created.
- **Fields**: Use **Add Field** to specify the fields and their corresponding values for the new record. You can use static values or map data from previous nodes in the workflow.

### How it works
- When the workflow reaches the Create Record node, it generates a new record in the selected table using the defined field values.
- The newly created record's data can be used in subsequent nodes within the workflow.

### Use cases
- Automatically add new entries based on user input or external data sources.
- Create related records in different tables as part of a multi-step process.
- Populate logs or audit trails with new records whenever specific actions occur in the workflow.
