The **Delete Record** action node in NocoDB workflows allows you to permanently remove existing records from a selected table as part of an automated workflow. This node is useful for cleanup operations, enforcing data retention policies, or removing records that no longer meet defined conditions.

### Configuration
- **Table**: Select the table that contains the record to be deleted.
- **Record ID**: Specify the record to delete. You can reference a record ID from a previous node or dynamically map it from the workflow context.

### How it works
- When the workflow reaches the Delete Record node, it identifies the specified record in the selected table.
- The record is permanently deleted from the table.
- The workflow then continues execution to subsequent nodes.

### Use cases
- Automatically remove obsolete or expired records.
- Delete records that fail validation or business rules.
- Enforce data lifecycle and retention policies through automated workflows.
