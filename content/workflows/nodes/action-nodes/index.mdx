In NocoDB workflows, **Action Nodes** are crucial components that perform specific operations or tasks as part of the workflow execution. These nodes enable you to manipulate data, send notifications, and integrate with other services, allowing for robust automation capabilities.

## Types of Action Nodes
NocoDB provides several Action Nodes to facilitate different operations within your workflows:
- **Create Record**: This node allows you to create a new record in a specified table. You can map data from previous nodes to the fields of the new record.
- **Update Record**: This node enables you to update an existing record in a specified table. You can select the record to update based on its ID and map new values to its fields.
- **Delete Record**: This node allows you to delete a record from a specified table based on its ID.
- **Find Record**: This node lets you search for records in a specified table based on defined criteria. You can use filters to narrow down the search results and retrieve specific records.
- **List Records**: This node retrieves one or more records from a specified table. You can apply filters to get a subset of records that meet certain conditions.
- **Send Email**: This node enables you to send email notifications as part of your workflow. You can configure the recipient, subject, and body of the email, and include dynamic data from previous nodes.

These Action Nodes empower you to build complex workflows that automate various tasks and processes within NocoDB, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
