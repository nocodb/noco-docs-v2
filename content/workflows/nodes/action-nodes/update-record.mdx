The **Update Record** action node in NocoDB workflows enables you to modify existing records in a selected table as part of an automated workflow. This node is useful when workflows need to change data based on conditions, inputs, or outputs from earlier steps.

### Configuration
- **Table**: Select the table that contains the record to be updated.
- **Record ID**: Specify ID of the record to update. You can reference a record ID from a previous node or dynamically map it from the workflow context.
- **Fields**: Use **Add Field** to define the fields and their new values. Values can be static or mapped from outputs of earlier nodes.

### How it works
- When the workflow reaches the Update Record node, it identifies the target record in the selected table.
- The specified fields are updated with the provided values.
- Updated record data is made available for use in subsequent workflow nodes.

### Use cases
- Update record status based on workflow conditions or approvals.
- Modify records using data fetched from external systems or APIs.
- Keep records in sync across related tables during multi-step workflows.
