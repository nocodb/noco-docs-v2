title: 'Save View Ordering to Field'
description: 'Preserve manual record ordering from any view by saving it as sequential numbers in a numeric field'
---

This script captures the current ordering of records in a selected view and saves it as sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) to a numeric field of your choice. This allows you to preserve manually arranged record sequences and apply the same ordering to other views.

```javascript
const config = input.config({
    title: 'Save view ordering to field',
    description: `A script to save the record ordering of a particular view to a specified field in the table.

This ordering can then be applied to other views by sorting on that field.

Useful when you want to apply the order from one view to another view after manually reordering records.`,
    items: [
        input.config.table('sourceTable', {
            label: 'Table',
            description: 'The table containing the view you want to save the ordering from'
        }),
        input.config.view('sourceView', {
            label: 'Source View',
            description: 'The view whose ordering you want to save to a field',
            parentTable: 'sourceTable'
        }),
        input.config.field('orderingField', {
            label: 'Order field',
            description: 'The field you want to save the ordering to, this must be a number field.',
            parentTable: 'sourceTable'
        })
    ]
});

if (config.orderingField.type !== UITypes.Number) {
    output.markdown(`**Error**: Order field must be of type number.`);
    return;
}

const { sourceTable, sourceView, orderingField } = config;

output.markdown(`#### Assigning ordering from view "${sourceView.name}" to field "${orderingField.name}"`);

// Process records in chunks to avoid loading everything into memory
const queryResult = await sourceView.selectRecordsAsync();
const UPDATE_BATCH_SIZE = 10;
let orderNumber = 1;
let totalProcessed = 0;

while (true) {
    // Get only the new records from this chunk (not already processed)
    const newRecords = queryResult.records.slice(totalProcessed);

    // If no new records to process, we're done
    if (newRecords.length === 0) {
        break;
    }

    output.markdown(`Processing chunk of ${newRecords.length} new records (starting from order ${orderNumber})`);

    // Prepare updates for current chunk
    const recordUpdates = [];
    for (const record of newRecords) {
        recordUpdates.push({
            id: record.id,
            fields: { [orderingField.name]: orderNumber }
        });
        orderNumber++;
    }

    // Update records in batches of 10 within this chunk
    let chunkProcessed = 0;
    while (chunkProcessed < recordUpdates.length) {
        const batchStart = chunkProcessed;
        const batchEnd = Math.min(chunkProcessed + UPDATE_BATCH_SIZE, recordUpdates.length);
        const currentBatch = recordUpdates.slice(batchStart, batchEnd);

        output.markdown(`  → Updating records ${totalProcessed + batchStart + 1} to ${totalProcessed + batchEnd}`);

        await sourceTable.updateRecordsAsync(currentBatch);
        chunkProcessed = batchEnd;
    }

    totalProcessed += recordUpdates.length;

    // Try to load more records if available
    if (queryResult.hasMoreRecords) {
        await queryResult.loadMoreRecords();
    }

### Use Cases

- **Preserve Manual Ordering**: Save custom record arrangements that took time to organize
- **Cross-View Consistency**: Apply the same ordering logic to multiple views
- **Priority Systems**: Create numbered priority sequences for tasks or items
- **Reference Ordering**: Maintain canonical record sequences for reporting
- **Backup Arrangements**: Preserve ordering before applying filters or sorts

### How it Works

1. **Select Source View**: Choose the view with the desired record ordering
2. **Choose Numeric Field**: Select a number field to store the sequence values
3. **Capture Ordering**: The script reads the current record order from the view
4. **Assign Numbers**: Sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) are written to the chosen field
5. **Apply Elsewhere**: Sort other views by this numeric field to reproduce the ordering

### Requirements

- A **Number field** in your table (preferably configured as an integer)
- A **view** with the desired record ordering already arranged
- **Write permissions** to modify the selected numeric field

### Workflow Example

**Step 1: Arrange Records**
```
View: "Priority Tasks"
Current Order:
- Complete project proposal
- Review budget requirements  
- Schedule team meeting
- Update documentation
```

**Step 2: Run Script**
- Select "Priority Tasks" view
- Choose "Sort Order" number field
- Execute script

**Step 3: Result**
```
Records with new Sort Order values:
- Complete project proposal → Sort Order: 1
- Review budget requirements → Sort Order: 2
- Schedule team meeting → Sort Order: 3
- Update documentation → Sort Order: 4
```

**Step 4: Reproduce Ordering**
- In any other view, sort by "Sort Order" field
- Records appear in the exact same sequence

### Benefits

- **Persistent Ordering**: Manual arrangements survive view changes and filters
- **Reusable Sequences**: Apply the same ordering logic across multiple views
- **Reference Standard**: Create a canonical ordering for your data
- **Time Saving**: Avoid re-arranging records manually in different views
- **Flexible Application**: Sort by the numeric field whenever you need the preserved order

### Best Practices

- Use an **integer Number field** for clean sequential values
- **Name the field clearly** (e.g., "Priority Order", "Display Sequence", "Sort Index")
- **Document the source view** so team members understand the ordering logic
- **Update periodically** if the preferred ordering changes
- **Combine with filters** to create ordered subsets of your data
