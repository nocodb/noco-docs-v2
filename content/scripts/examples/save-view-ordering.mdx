title: 'Save View Ordering to Field'
description: 'Preserve manual record ordering from any view by saving it as sequential numbers in a numeric field'
---

This script captures the current ordering of records in a selected view and saves it as sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) to a numeric field of your choice. This allows you to preserve manually arranged record sequences and apply the same ordering to other views.

### Use Cases

- **Preserve Manual Ordering**: Save custom record arrangements that took time to organize
- **Cross-View Consistency**: Apply the same ordering logic to multiple views
- **Priority Systems**: Create numbered priority sequences for tasks or items
- **Reference Ordering**: Maintain canonical record sequences for reporting
- **Backup Arrangements**: Preserve ordering before applying filters or sorts

### How it Works

1. **Select Source View**: Choose the view with the desired record ordering
2. **Choose Numeric Field**: Select a number field to store the sequence values
3. **Capture Ordering**: The script reads the current record order from the view
4. **Assign Numbers**: Sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) are written to the chosen field
5. **Apply Elsewhere**: Sort other views by this numeric field to reproduce the ordering

### Requirements

- A **Number field** in your table (preferably configured as an integer)
- A **view** with the desired record ordering already arranged
- **Write permissions** to modify the selected numeric field

### Workflow Example

**Step 1: Arrange Records**
```
View: "Priority Tasks"
Current Order:
- Complete project proposal
- Review budget requirements  
- Schedule team meeting
- Update documentation
```

**Step 2: Run Script**
- Select "Priority Tasks" view
- Choose "Sort Order" number field
- Execute script

**Step 3: Result**
```
Records with new Sort Order values:
- Complete project proposal → Sort Order: 1
- Review budget requirements → Sort Order: 2
- Schedule team meeting → Sort Order: 3
- Update documentation → Sort Order: 4
```

**Step 4: Reproduce Ordering**
- In any other view, sort by "Sort Order" field
- Records appear in the exact same sequence

### Benefits

- **Persistent Ordering**: Manual arrangements survive view changes and filters
- **Reusable Sequences**: Apply the same ordering logic across multiple views
- **Reference Standard**: Create a canonical ordering for your data
- **Time Saving**: Avoid re-arranging records manually in different views
- **Flexible Application**: Sort by the numeric field whenever you need the preserved order

### Best Practices

- Use an **integer Number field** for clean sequential values
- **Name the field clearly** (e.g., "Priority Order", "Display Sequence", "Sort Index")
- **Document the source view** so team members understand the ordering logic
- **Update periodically** if the preferred ordering changes
- **Combine with filters** to create ordered subsets of your data
