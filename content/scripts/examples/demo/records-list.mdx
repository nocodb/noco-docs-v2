title: 'Records: Pagination'
description: 'This script demonstrates how to load and display records from a selected table in NocoDB, with pagination support for large datasets.'
---

```javascript
// Ask user to select a table
const table = await input.tableAsync('Select a table to load records from');

// Initial query with small page size
const result = await table.selectRecordsAsync({ pageSize: 50 });

// Initial log
output.text(`Loading records from "${table.name}"...`);

// Track total loaded so far
let previouslyLoaded = result.records.length;
output.text(`Loaded ${previouslyLoaded} records so far...`);

// Load all records using pagination, with progress updates
while (result.hasMoreRecords) {
  await result.loadMoreRecords();
  const newlyLoaded = result.records.length;
  const batchSize = newlyLoaded - previouslyLoaded;
  previouslyLoaded = newlyLoaded;
  output.text(`→ Loaded ${batchSize} more. Total so far: ${newlyLoaded}`);
}

// Final count
output.text(`✅ Done. Total records loaded from "${table.name}": ${result.records.length}`);
