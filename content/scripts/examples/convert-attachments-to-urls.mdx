### Overview

This script processes attachment fields in your table and converts them into comma-separated URL strings. This is particularly useful when you need to send attachment URLs to third-party integration services that expect URL strings rather than attachment objects.

### How it Works

1. **Select Source Field**: Choose an attachment field containing the files you want to convert
2. **Choose Target Field**: Select a text field where the comma-separated URLs will be written
3. **Process Records**: The script processes each record, extracting URLs from attachments
4. **Output Format**: URLs are joined with commas: `url1,url2,url3`

### Requirements

- An **Attachment field** with uploaded files
- A **Text field** to store the comma-separated URL output

### Example

**Before:**
- Attachment Field: `[file1.pdf, image2.jpg, document3.docx]`
- URL Field: `(empty)`

**After:**
- Attachment Field: `[file1.pdf, image2.jpg, document3.docx]` _(unchanged)_
- URL Field: `https://example.com/file1.pdf,https://example.com/image2.jpg,https://example.com/document3.docx`
