NocoDB Inc, doing business as NocoDB (“we” or “our”) created these Trademark Guidelines (“Guidelines”) to help you understand how to properly use our name, trademarks, logos, designs, service marks, or other brand assets (“NocoDB Marks”).

By using NocoDB Marks, you agree to follow these Guidelines. We reserve the right to modify or revoke any allowed uses under these Guidelines at any time in our sole discretion.

## Using NocoDB Marks
### General
Our primary logo includes an icon and our full wordmark. The logo must appear clearly, and should never be modified, distorted, or redrawn.

Whenever you are using NocoDB Marks, your description must be truthful and may not imply that you are associated, affiliated, sponsored, or endorsed with or by us in any way.

You must also clearly attribute NocoDB as the owner of the NocoDB Marks (for example, "NocoDB and the NocoDB trademark are trademarks of NocoDB Inc doing business as NocoDB.”).

Remember that trademarks are adjectives, not nouns or verbs, and should not be used as a plural or possessive. Use the NocoDB trademark only as an adjective followed by the appropriate noun describing the product or service (e.g., the NocoDB platform).

### What’s Allowed
Following these Guidelines, you may use NocoDB Marks to:

- Reference NocoDB or our products or services in an informational context in articles, websites, etc., provided such reference is not confusing or misleading. Including a disclaimer such as, “This [product, service, or other content type] is not endorsed by, sponsored by, or affiliated with NocoDB” can help avoid confusion.

- Use NocoDB Marks to accurately describe how your product or service relates to NocoDB (e.g., “Compatible with NocoDB” or “Built with NocoDB”).
