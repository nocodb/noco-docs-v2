**Last updated â€“ July 21, 2025**

THESE TERMS OF USE ("AGREEMENT") ARE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE COMPANY YOU REPRESENT (COLLECTIVELY "YOU" OR "YOUR"), AND NOCODB, INC. ("US," "WE" OR "OUR") GOVERNING YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES USE OF OUR WEBSITES AND RESOURCES POSTED THERE, AS WELL AS USE OF THE NOCODB CLOUD MANAGED SERVICE. THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO NOR DOES IT REPLACE OPEN SOURCE LICENSE TERMS FOR OPEN SOURCE VERSIONS OF NOCODB MADE AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE.

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIM BASIS ONLY AND WITHOUT A JURY TRIAL.

THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, TOGETHER WITH YOUR ORDER (MADE ONLINE OR BY ORDER FORM), AND THE NOCODB PRIVACY POLICY WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE: [https://nocodb.com/privacy/](/docs/product-docs/legal/privacy).

NocoDB, Inc. (together with its affiliates, the "Company") owns and operates a hosted, proprietary enterprise platform engineered to facilitate the creation of user-friendly databases and applications on supported cloud services. This solution, along with related services and updates, enhancements, and Our websites used in connection with the foregoing are referred to in this Agreement as the "Services."

These Terms of Use apply to You and Your use of the Services, including any others you permit to use the Services. If you do not accept all terms of this Agreement including the Privacy Policy, then You may not use the Services. Your use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of this Agreement.

## 1. Use of the Services

Subject the terms and conditions of this Agreement, We hereby grant You a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable right as specified during an online purchase or in an order form (Your "Order") to access and use the Services ordered only in accordance with this Agreement, the terms of the Order, NocoDB's published Documentation, and solely for Your internal business purposes.

Your use of the Services is subject to certain limitations as stated in Your Order and the Documentation, such as on the duration of Your subscription ("Subscription Term"), the number and types of named users permitted to access the Services, data pass-through volumes, and any other limits specified in the Order ("Usage Limits''). You will be charged the applicable Fees for any use in excess of the Usage Limits at then-current prices.

User subscriptions to Services cannot be shared or used by more than one (1) named user but may be reassigned to a new user replacing a person who no longer requires access to the Service. You are solely responsible for selecting secure account and user passwords, changing passwords frequently, maintaining the confidentiality of user logins and passwords, and restricting access to the Services. We assume no responsibility for damage or loss arising from unauthorized access to the Services and Your account due to Your failure to protect Your account through proper security and maintenance of User logins and passwords.

## 2. Technical Preview

If You ordered a "preview", or "trial" or other limited function edition of the Services under a no-charge plan ("Technical Preview"), You may use the Service until you have either reached the Usage Limits specified, such as a fixed limit of data pass-through after which your right to use the Services expires, or for ninety (90) days, whichever occurs first (the "Trial Period").

You may use the Services under the Technical Preview plan solely for Your evaluation purposes, but not in a production setting. The Services will automatically cease functioning at the end of the Trial Period and all data an information hosted by the Services will no longer be available to you unless (i) You supply Your payment card or other payment information and purchase a paid subscription to the Service; or (ii) NocoDB extends Your Trial Period in writing in its sole and absolute discretion.

You acknowledge and accept that We may terminate Your use of the Services under the Technical Preview for any reason or no reason at all and without any required prior notice. DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD AND USE UNDER THE TECHNICAL PREVIEW, WE WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER TO CONTINUE PROVIDING THE SERVICES TO YOU. We provide the Services under the Technical Preview: (a) free of charge; (b) "AS IS"; and (c) WITHOUT INDEMNIFICATION, WARRANTY, OR LIABILITY TO YOU OF ANY KIND. USE OF THE TECHNICAL PREVIEW IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 3. Restrictions on Use

You shall pay all Fees due associated with Your Use of the Services as set forth on Your Order ("Fees"). Notwithstanding the duration of Your Subscription Term, if You have met or exceeded Usage Limits, such as the data pass-through volume limit, You will be unable to use the Services until you have ordered and paid for additional credits or entitlements. Unused credits against Usage Limits expire at the end of the Subscription Term unless the Subscription Term is renewed prior to its expiration date.

#### I. Invoiced Customers

If you have been approved by Us to be invoiced for payments, then unless otherwise stated in Your Order, You will pay all Fees in accordance with the following: (a) Fees are invoiced in advance for the entire Subscription Term; (b) payment will be due within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. Once accepted by Us, Your Order is non-cancellable and nonrefundable except as provided in this Agreement, and the Subscription Term as set forth in the order form is a continuous and non-divisible commitment for the entire duration of the Subscription Term.

#### II. Payment Cards/Electronic Payments

If Your Order specifies payment by a payment card or a supported electronic payment processing service ("Payment Account"), We will charge Your Payment Account for the full amount of Subscription Term Fees at the time of Your Order, which amount is not cancellable or refundable; (c) any additional purchases You make during the Subscription Term, such as adding Users or credits for data pass-through volumes, or if you exceed Usage Limits, We will charge the applicable amount to Your Payment Account at the time you order the additional purchases or exceed the Usage Limits.

Your Payment Account will be charged for all applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions. If your Payment Account declines Your purchase, we may suspend the Services until you establish a new Payment Account and pay all Fees due. You are responsible for keeping all Payment Account information accurate and up-to-date, including payment card, address, and account information needed by Us to charge your Payment Account.

You hereby represent that You have the right to provide Us with Your Payment Account information and authorize Us to charge Your Payment Account for all Fees as they come due. You agree to pay all charges incurred by Users of Your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Services at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred.

You shall be responsible for paying all sales, use, value added or other taxes we are required to collect, except for taxes based on Our income. For unpaid amounts due, not properly disputed, We may, without prejudicing any other rights or remedies available to Us, charge interest at the rate of 1% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, and suspend the Services until You have paid all Fees due. You will reimburse any costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Us reasonably necessary to collect any amount that is not paid when due, and not properly disputed.

Calculations regarding Usage Limits will be based on Our system reports as the system of record. You will pay all amounts that are determined to be payable by resolution of the dispute within ten (10) days following such resolution.

## 8. Term and Termination

This Agreement commences when You accept the terms, and expires on the date of expiration or termination of all Subscription Terms ("Term of Agreement"). Each Order will state the Subscription Term for the Services ordered.

### a. Auto-Renewal; Pricing

At the end of each Subscription Term, Your Order shall automatically renew for an additional Subscription Term of equal duration at the then-current pricing in effect as posted on Our website or communicated to You at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of Subscription Term, unless You or We notify the other party of the intent not to renew at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the current Subscription Term.

### b. Termination

You may choose to terminate this Agreement and all orders at any time for any reason with written notice, provided that upon such termination You will not be entitled to a refund of prepaid Fees, and all remaining Fees for a then-current order or Subscription Term that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other party for cause: (i) if after such notice period a material breach by the other party remains uncured, or (ii) if the other party becomes the subject of a petition of bankruptcy, or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.

After the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason Your account shall be deactivated and all Customer Data deleted unless retention is required by law. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive cancellation or termination of this Agreement shall survive cancellation or termination.

## 9. Confidentiality

### a. Definition of Confidential Information

As used herein, "Confidential Information" means all confidential information disclosed by a party to this Agreement ("Disclosing Party") to the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Your Confidential Information shall include Customer Data and any ancillary information, such as account information for Users.

Confidential Information shall not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was or becomes known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party as evidenced by written records, or (iii) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.

### b. Protection of Confidential Information

Receiving Party shall not disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any third party except as permitted by this Agreement. Receiving Party shall only use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information (but in no event less than reasonable care).

Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, consultants, agents, and data Subprocessors (collectively "Representatives"), who reasonably need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement, provided that Receiving Party shall ensure that such employees, consultants and agents are bound by obligations of confidentiality at least as protective of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as the obligations in this Section. Receiving Party shall be liable for any disclosures of Confidential Information by its Representatives.

### c. Compelled Disclosure

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law or governmental authority to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. The Receiving Party shall limit any disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section to the extent strictly necessary to comply with the applicable request by such governmental entity. Any disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section shall not affect the confidential treatment of such disclosed Confidential Information.

### d. Remedies

Receiving Party agrees that a breach of this Section may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party that money damages alone may be inadequate to compensate. Therefore, in the event of such a breach, the parties stipulate and agree that the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek and obtain equitable relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.

## 10. Indemnification

### a. By Us

We shall defend, indemnify and hold You harmless from and against all claims, losses and damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees) made by a third party against You that the Services infringes that third party's United States intellectual property rights, except to the extent such a claim arises from Your misuse or unauthorized use of the Services.

If We believe that any portion of the Services may be subject to such a claim, then We may, at Our sole option and expense, procure for You the right to continue using the Service, modify or replace the infringing portions of the Service to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not commercially reasonable, refund any unused, prepaid Fees and terminate this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Our indemnification obligations set forth in this Section do not apply to, and We will have no obligation to You for, any claim that arises from (i) modifications to the Service by anyone other than Us or a third-party expressly instructed on Our behalf, (ii) modifications to the Service based upon specifications furnished by You (iii) You and/or any of Your Users' unauthorized use of the Service other than as specified in this Agreement, the Order Form or in the applicable Documentation, or (iv) use of the Service in conjunction with third-party software, hardware, data, or services, or any other combination of the foregoing, unless such item is identified by Us as part of the system requirements for the Services.

THIS SECTION 10(A) STATES OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND SHALL NOT APPLY DURING ANY TRIAL PERIOD OR UNDER ANY FREE PLAN.

### b. By You

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Us harmless from and against all claims, losses and damages, suits, government investigations, fines, actions, damages, settlements, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) for any breach of Your representations, warranties and covenants set forth in Section 11(d), or breach of Section 3 ("Restrictions on Use").

### c. Indemnification Procedures

As a condition to being indemnified under this Agreement, the party seeking indemnification shall: (i) promptly notify the indemnifying party of the claim; (ii) allow the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of such claim; and (iii) provide assistance, at the indemnifying party's expense, in defending or settling the claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party informed of and consult with the indemnified party in connection with the progress of such litigation or settlement, and not settle any such claim in a manner that does not unconditionally release the indemnified party without the indemnified party's written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

For any dispute with Us, You agree to first contact Us and attempt to resolve the dispute with Us informally. In the unlikely event that We have not been able to resolve a dispute with You after sixty (60) days, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement on an individual basis only and not on behalf of a class, or the breach hereof, shall be settled by arbitration in the city of San Francisco, California, by binding arbitration by JAMS, Inc. ("JAMS"), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS. JAMS may be contacted and its rules reviewed at www.jamsadr.com. Any award shall be final, binding and conclusive. A judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief from the courts in appropriate cases.

## 16. Publicity

Neither Party shall refer to the identity of the other Party in promotional material, publications or other forms of publicity relating to the Service unless the prior written consent of the other Party has been obtained; provided, however, that We may use Your name and logo for the limited purpose of identifying You as a customer of Our Services on Our websites, and in other marketing materials distributed by Us (which may include emails and other web and print materials), and We agree to comply with any trademark usage policies or brand guidelines You provide to Us for such purposes.

## 18. Assignment

Neither party shall assign this Agreement without the written consent of the other party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except assignment without consent but with written notice is permitted in the event of a merger, acquisition, sale of substantially all the assets of a party or any similar transaction. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

## 19. Entire Agreement

This Agreement, along with Your Order and the exhibits attached hereto or incorporated by reference, constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings.
