This Master Subscription Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into by and between the organization (“Customer”) identified on the order form, online purchase confirmation, or other ordering document entered into by the parties and referencing this Agreement (the “Order Form”) and NocoDB Inc, doing business as NocoDB (“NocoDB”) (Customer and NocoDB each, a “party” and collectively, the “parties”) and sets forth the terms and conditions under which Customer subscribes to or uses NocoDB’s products and services described in the Order Form. The Order Form incorporates this Agreement and is effective as of the date Customer agrees to it (the “Effective Date”).

NocoDB Components are Services within the meaning of this Agreement.

### 1.3. Professional Services
NocoDB and Customer may enter into an Order Form or mutually agreed statement of work (“SOW”) under this Agreement for the provision of implementation, configuration, integration, advisory, or other professional services (“Professional Services”). The nature and scope of such Professional Services, and the fees for such Professional Services, shall be set forth in such Order Form or SOW.

Customer shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of each Permitted User.  Customer shall require that all Permitted Users keep user ID and password information used to access the Services strictly confidential and not share such information with any unauthorized person. Customer shall be responsible for any and all actions taken using Customer’s, and Customer’s Permitted Users’, accounts and passwords.

As used herein, “control” means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity and the beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of an entity.  Each of Customer’s Affiliates may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement by entering into an Order Form with NocoDB directly that explicitly references and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of any such Order Form, the term Customer, as used in this Agreement, shall mean the Affiliate who entered into the Order Form.

### 1.6. Acceptable Use and Usage Restrictions
Customer will comply with, and will ensure its Permitted Users comply with, NocoDB’s [Acceptable Use Policy](/docs/product-docs/legal/aup) at [www.nocodb.com/aup](/docs/product-docs/legal/aup) (“AUP”), which is incorporated herein by reference. NocoDB reserves the right to suspend access to the Services by any Permitted User whom NocoDB reasonable suspects is in violation of the AUP.

Customer may elect to participate in a Product Trial, subject to any additional terms and conditions made available by NocoDB. Customer acknowledges that product features made available to Customer as part of a Product Trial (“Trial Features”) are not considered part of the Services and may contain bugs, errors, or omissions.  Trial Features might never be made available for general use, and NocoDB may discontinue Trial Features, or revoke Customer’s access to Trial Features, at any time, which may have the effect of making Customer Data inaccessible to Customer.  TRIAL FEATURES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, OR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SLA OR ANY OTHER SERVICE OR SUPPORT COMMITMENTS.

### 1.9. Noco AI
“Noco AI” means the features and functionality of the Services made available to Customer that utilize generative artificial intelligence models. Customer and its Permitted Users’ use of Noco AI will be subject to this Agreement and the [Noco AI Terms](/docs/product-docs/legal/ai-terms) at [www.nocodb.com/ai-terms](/docs/product-docs/legal/ai-terms) (“AI Terms”), which are incorporated herein by reference.

### 1.10. Purchasing through an NocoDB Partner
Purchases of Services through a reseller, distributor, or other partner of NocoDB (“NocoDB Partner”) will be made through a separate agreement or ordering document between Customer and the NocoDB Partner (“Partner Sales Agreement”), which shall address, as between Customer and such NocoDB Partner, any terms and conditions relating to the quantity of products and services purchased, fees, payment (including any applicable refunds), taxes, and renewals. The Partner Sales Agreement is not binding on NocoDB, and any disputes related to the Partner Sales Agreement shall be handled directly between Customer and the NocoDB Partner.

### 2.2. Limited License to Customer Data
As between the parties, Customer shall retain all right, title, and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) in and to Customer Data. Customer hereby grants to NocoDB a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free, limited-term license to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and display the Customer Data in order to: (a) provide, maintain, improve, or optimize use of the Services; and (b) perform such other actions as authorized or instructed by Customer in writing (email to suffice).

### 3.1. Extension Development
Customer or its Permitted Users may elect, in their discretion, to develop, test, or support Customer-developed or third-party-developed applications or extensions (collectively, “Extensions”) that integrate with the Services. Customer acknowledges that NocoDB does not control, and is not responsible for, any Extensions, including any content, data, or other information provided by such Extensions.

The Services do not require any Third-Party Services for operation, and Customer is under no obligation to use any Third-Party Services. NocoDB does not endorse, and is not and will not be responsible or liable for, any Third-Party Services, nor for any act or omission of any provider of Third-Party Services, nor for any act or omission of any Permitted  User in connection with any Third-Party Services.

## 6. TERM AND TERMINATION
### 6.1. Term
This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and will continue in effect until terminated as set forth below. Unless otherwise terminated as set forth below, each Order Form will have a term as set forth therein (the “Service Term”). If no term is stated on an Order Form, the Service Term for such Order Form is one (1) year.

### 6.2. Termination
Either party may terminate this Agreement with at least fifteen  (15) days’ prior written notice if there are no Order Forms then in effect. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party: (a) materially breaches the Agreement and such breach is incapable of cure, or with respect to a breach capable of cure (including a failure to pay fees), the breaching party does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice (such notice must contain sufficient detail as to the nature of the breach and state the intent to terminate, and email notice is sufficient in the case of non-payment); (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter. Termination of this Agreement will automatically terminate all Order Forms.

### 6.3. Effect of Termination
Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement: (a) Customer shall immediately cease any and all use of and access to the Services; and (b) each party will return to the other party (or destroy) such other party’s Confidential Information upon request. Except as otherwise set forth herein, termination of this Agreement is not an exclusive remedy, and the exercise by either party of any remedy under this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.

### 6.4. Refund or Payment upon Termination for Material Breach
If Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section [6.2](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#62-termination), then NocoDB will refund to Customer any prepaid, unused fees covering the period from the effective date of such termination through the remainder of the Service Term for all outstanding Order Forms.  If NocoDB terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section [6.2](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#62-termination),  Customer will pay to NocoDB any unpaid fees covering the period from the effective date of such termination through the remainder of the Service Term for all outstanding Order Forms.  In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees payable to NocoDB for the period prior to the effective date of termination. For the avoidance of doubt, prepaid fees shall be deemed consumed on a per diem basis over the applicable Service Term.

### 6.5. Customer Data
At any time before or within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer may download Customer Data directly from the Services. Upon request by Customer at the expiration or termination of the Service Term, subject to applicable legal requirements, NocoDB shall cause all Customer Data to be removed from NocoDB’s systems, applications, databases, and servers (including, without limitation, as backups and/or archives) within ninety (90) days of such request. NocoDB shall not be responsible or liable for any adverse impact on Customer’s use of the Services caused by Customer’s deletion of Customer Data during the Service Term. To the extent NocoDB retains any Customer Data subject to applicable legal requirements, NocoDB shall implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate measures to ensure that all such retained Customer Data is: (a) segregated; (b) secured in a manner consistent with Sections [11](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#11-security) and [12](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#12-data-processing) of this Agreement; and (c) not accessed, used, shared, disclosed, or otherwise processed except as required to comply with such applicable legal requirements for which the Customer Data is retained.

## 7. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER
### 7.1. NocoDB Warranty
NocoDB warrants that it will provide the Services in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation and the descriptions in the Order Form. NocoDB’s entire liability (and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty shall be, in NocoDB’s sole and reasonable discretion and at no charge to Customer, to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with an error correction or work-around that corrects the reported non-conformity, or if NocoDB determines such remedy to be impracticable, to allow Customer to terminate the Order Form for any portion of the Services affected by such breach and receive as its sole remedy and NocoDB’s entire liability, a refund of any unused fees prepaid by Customer for use of the Services that it has not received as of the date of the warranty claim. The warranty set forth in this Section shall not apply: (a) unless Customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Customer first becomes aware of the non-conforming condition; (b) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications, or third-party hardware, software, or services; or (c) to Trial Features or other Services provided on a no-charge or evaluation basis.

### 7.2. Customer Warranties
Customer warrants that: (a) Customer’s use of the Services and all Customer Data is and will at all times be compliant with Customer’s privacy policies and all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and conventions, including, without limitation, those related to data privacy, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal data; (b) Customer has sufficient rights in the Customer Data to grant the rights granted to NocoDB in Section [2.2](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#22-limited-license-to-customer-data); and (c) the Customer Data does not infringe upon, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the rights of any third party.

### 7.3. Warranty Disclaimer
EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN [SECTION 7.1](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#71-nocodb-warranty) OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NOCODB AND ITS SUPPLIERS EACH EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 8. INDEMNIFICATION
### 8.1. Indemnification by NocoDB
NocoDB shall defend Customer from and against any claims by a third party alleging that the Services, when used in accordance with the terms of  this Agreement, infringe a patent, copyright, or trademark, and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any costs, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from such claim. If Customer’s use of any Services is, or in NocoDB’s opinion is likely to be, enjoined or subject to a claim for infringement, or if required by settlement, NocoDB may, in its sole and reasonable discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Services; or, if (a) and (b) are commercially impracticable in NocoDB’s sole judgment, (c) terminate the applicable Order Form or this Agreement and refund to Customer any unused fees prepaid by Customer for the terminated period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NocoDB shall have no liability under this Section, and no obligation to indemnify Customer, for any claim to the extent it arises from: (i) any modification of the Services other than by NocoDB or explicitly permitted by NocoDB; (ii) access to or use of the Services in combination with any materials or services not provided by NocoDB or specified in the Documentation; (iii) Customer’s breach of this Agreement, or use of the Services in breach of this Agreement or in violation of applicable law; (iv) Customer Data; or (v) Customer’s fraud or willful misconduct. THIS SECTION [8.1](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#81-indemnification-by-nocodb) SETS FORTH NOCODB’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.

Customer shall defend NocoDB from and against any claims by a third party arising from or relating to (a) Customer Data or (b) Customer’s use of the Services in breach of Section [1.6](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#16-acceptable-use-and-usage-restrictions) (Acceptable Use and Usage Restrictions), and will indemnify and hold harmless NocoDB from and against any costs, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from such claim; provided, however, that Customer shall have no liability under this Section, and no obligation to indemnify NocoDB, for any claim to the extent it arises from NocoDB’s breach of this Agreement.

### 8.3. Indemnification Procedures
If a party entitled to indemnification becomes aware of any indemnifiable claim, the indemnified party will provide the indemnifying party with: (a) prompt written notice of such claim such that the indemnifying party has sufficient time to respond without material prejudice; (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of such claim (as long as such settlement releases the indemnified party from any and all liability); and (c) all reasonable cooperation assisting the indemnifying party's investigation, defense, and settlement of such matter requested by the indemnifying party.

## 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO EITHER PARTY’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION [8](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#8-indemnification) (INDEMNIFICATION): (A) NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE, UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY OF LAW, WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, CONTRACTS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, PRODUCTION, AND ANTICIPATED SAVINGS OR DATA, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE; AND (B) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL DAMAGES AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO NOCODB OR TO AN NOCODB PARTNER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO WHEN THE CLAIM AROSE, PROVIDED THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND SHALL NOT LIMIT CUSTOMER'S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE “FEES AND PAYMENT” SECTION ABOVE.

## 10. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
### 10.1. Definition
“Confidential Information” means information disclosed by one party (the “Discloser”) to the other (the “Recipient”) that is marked as confidential or proprietary, or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential or proprietary, including Confidential Information disclosed prior to the Effective Date. All NocoDB Technology, performance information relating to the Services, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement and each Order Form (including the fees and pricing information) shall be deemed Confidential Information of NocoDB without any marking or further designation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, Confidential Information does not include information that the Recipient already lawfully knew, becomes public through no fault of the Recipient, was independently developed by the Recipient without any reference to or use of Confidential Information, or was rightfully obtained by the Recipient from a third party.

### 10.2. Obligations
The Recipient will use reasonable care to protect the Discloser’s Confidential Information, and will use the Discloser’s Confidential Information only for its internal business purposes, to exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations under the Agreement (including, in NocoDB’s case, to provide the Services to Customer), and to explore potential business transactions with the Discloser.  The Recipient will not disclose Confidential Information except to its Affiliates, employees, agents, professional advisors, and contractors (“Representatives”) who need to know it and have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. The Recipient will ensure that its Representatives are subject to confidentiality obligations that are no less restrictive than those herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information: (a) if directed to do so by the Discloser; or (b) to the extent required by applicable legal process, provided that the Recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to (i) promptly notify the Discloser in advance, to the extent permitted by law, and (ii) comply with the Discloser’s reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment. With respect to each Order Form, the obligations set forth in this Section will survive for the duration of the Service Term set forth therein and three (3) years following the expiration or termination thereof.  Unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information may cause harm not compensable by damages, and the Discloser may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, without posting a bond, to protect its Confidential Information.

## 11. SECURITY

NocoDB has implemented and maintains appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the security and integrity of the Services and Customer Data. NocoDB maintains a robust security and privacy program and is **SOC 2 Type II compliant**.

Upon Customer’s written request (email to suffice), NocoDB will provide a copy of its most recent **SOC 2 Type II audit report** for review. This report shall be considered NocoDB’s Confidential Information.

## 12. DATA PROCESSING

NocoDB uses certain “personal data,” “personal information,” or “sensitive data” (as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (“CCPA”)) (“Personal Data”) to operate, develop and improve the Services, as detailed in NocoDB’s [privacy policy](/docs/product-docs/legal/privacy) at [www.nocodb.com/privacy](/docs/product-docs/legal/privacy).


## 13. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

NocoDB shall comply with any United States laws and regulations to the extent applicable to NocoDB’s provision of the Services to its customers generally (i.e., without regard for Customer’s particular use of the Services), as well as any laws and regulations applicable to this Agreement.  For clarity, NocoDB shall not be responsible for Customer’s compliance with any laws and regulations specific to Customer or its industry.

Moreover, neither party will take any action that would cause either party to be in violation of any anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, including without limitation the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and any other applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption law or regulation.

### 13.3. Export and Sanctions Compliance

Except as otherwise agreed in writing (email to suffice), neither party may use the other party’s name, logo, trademarks, designs, service marks, or other brand assets (“Marks”) without such party’s written approval in each case, except that NocoDB may identify Customer as an NocoDB customer, and may include Customer's name and logo, on NocoDB's website, in press releases or statements to the media, and in marketing and promotional materials, in each case in accordance with any branding guidelines provided by Customer.  Customer may opt out of such use of its name and logo by emailing NocoDB at support@nocodb.com at any time.  Any use by Customer of NocoDB’s Marks is subject to NocoDB’s [Trademark Guidelines](/docs/product-docs/legal/trademark-guidelines) at [www.nocodb.com/trademark-guidelines](/docs/product-docs/legal/trademark-guidelines).

## 15. GENERAL TERMS
### 15.1. Assignment
This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder except upon the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder without consent in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party’s assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section will be null and void.

### 15.2. Force Majeure
Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events which occur after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of government (including legislation, regulation, or other act of government rendering some or all of Customer’s use of the Services unlawful, in NocoDB’s reasonable discretion), epidemic, pandemic, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, or failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services (each, a “Force Majeure Event”). For clarity, this provision does not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay fees for services provided by NocoDB that are unaffected by a Force Majeure Event.

### 15.3. Independent Contractors
The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

### 15.4. Severability
If any provision of this Agreement is adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in effect.

### 15.5. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court in San Francisco County), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in binding arbitration.  The Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) will administer the arbitration in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (though to the extent JAMS’ Expedited Arbitration Procedures are available, they will apply), and the arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section [15.5](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#155-governing-law-jurisdiction-and-venue), the jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the state and United States federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and both parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

### 15.6. Notice
Any notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing to the parties at the addresses first listed on an applicable Order Form (email to suffice) or at such other address as may be given in writing by either party to the other in accordance with this Section and shall be deemed to have been received by the addressee: (a) immediately upon receipt, if personally delivered; (b) the first business day after sending, if by email; (c) the first business day following dispatch, if sent by overnight courier service; or (d) upon receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested.

### 15.7. Amendments and Waivers
Except as set forth in Section [15.10](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa#1510-modifications), no supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding, unless executed in writing or via click-through execution by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement or otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement, including terms incorporated by reference herein. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived. Purchase orders (and similar documents) issued by Customer are for administrative purposes only (e.g. setting forth products and services ordered and associated fees) and any additional or different terms or conditions contained in any such document shall not apply (even if the order is accepted or performed on by NocoDB).

### 15.8. No Third-Party Rights
There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

### 15.9. Construction
This Agreement has been reviewed, considered, and/or negotiated by the parties and their respective legal counsel, if any, and any legal or equitable principles that might require or permit the construction of this Agreement or any provision hereof against the party drafting this Agreement shall not apply in any construction or interpretation of this Agreement.  The words “hereof”, “herein” and “hereunder” and words of like import used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.  The captions herein are included for convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation hereof. Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term the singular.  Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”, whether or not they are in fact followed by those words or words of like import.  “Writing”, “written” and comparable terms refer to printing, typing, and other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible form.  References to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute as amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.  References to any person or entity include the successors and permitted assigns of that person or entity. Except as otherwise provided herein, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and an Order Form, the Order Form shall control.

### 15.10. Modifications
NocoDB may change this Agreement from time to time by posting a modified version on its website, such as at [www.nocodb.com/msa](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa).  If, in NocoDB’s sole discretion, the changes are material, NocoDB will provide Customer with reasonable notice prior to the effective date of the changes, either by emailing the email address associated with Customer’s account or by notifying Customer (including any person designated as an administrator on Customer’s account) through the Services. A materially-modified Agreement will become effective on the date set forth in the notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting thereof. By continuing to access or use the Services after the effective date of changes to this Agreement, Customer agrees to be bound by the modified version of the Agreement. If NocoDB fails to provide Customer with notice of material changes to this Agreement in accordance with this Section, then Customer’s subscription to and use of the Services will continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement as they were immediately prior to such modifications, until Customer’s next renewal date, after which the modified Agreement will govern.

### 15.11. Entire Agreement
This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties, and supersedes and cancels all previous or inconsistent written and oral agreements and communications, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.  To the extent any issue or claim arising under this Agreement relates to multiple Order Forms, including Order Forms signed before the Effective Date, this Agreement shall take precedence over any other agreement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and govern such issue or claim.  Any pre-printed terms in a Customer purchase order or similar document are null and void. Subject to this Agreement, the parties expressly object to any different or additional terms set forth in any purchase order, acceptance, vendor portal, code of conduct, or other ordering documentation, and neither party’s later failure to object to any such different or additional terms nor its use or acceptance of any such other document or materials will be deemed acceptance thereof or a waiver of any of the terms hereof.
