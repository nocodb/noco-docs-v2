The following disclosures of NocoDB Inc, doing business as NocoDB ("NocoDB," "we," "our," or "us"), are directed to residents of the European Union (EU). These disclosures may change as NocoDB grows and evolves, so please check back regularly for updates and modifications to this page.

## Definitions
As used in these disclosures, "Service Terms" means the agreement, if any (such as NocoDB’s [Terms of Service](/docs/product-docs/legal/terms-of-service) or a [Master Subscription Agreement](/docs/product-docs/legal/msa)), between you or your organization (collectively, “you” or “your”) and NocoDB that governs your use of NocoDB's products and services (the "Services"). "Your Content" means information, data, and other content, in any form or medium, that is collected, downloaded, or otherwise received, directly or indirectly, from you (or on your behalf) by or through the Services.

## EU DSA Point of Contact
Communications regarding compliance with the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) should be directed to legal@nocodb.com.

## Policies and Procedures for Moderation of User Content
For information on the restrictions that apply to content on the Services and how we enforce violations of these restrictions, please see our [Acceptable Use Policy](/docs/product-docs/legal/aup).

## Tools Used for Content Moderation
We use a combination of technology and human review to evaluate compliance with our Service Terms, including our [Acceptable Use Policy](/docs/product-docs/legal/aup).  Where Your Content or an NocoDB account is flagged for human review, our review team evaluates the content or account and the reasons it was flagged and makes a decision as to whether to take action on it.  We then use technology and human effort to remove content and accounts that we determine to be in violation of the applicable agreement or our [Acceptable Use Policy](/docs/product-docs/legal/aup).  If we make a decision to remove Your Content, suspend or terminate your account, or take other actions, we will notify you as required by the DSA.

## Notification of Illegal Content
If you wish to notify us of content that you believe violates EU or EU Member State law, you may email us at legal@nocodb.com.  Please include the following information in your email: (i) a detailed explanation of why you believe the content is illegal under EU or EU Member State law; (ii) the URL of the allegedly-illegal content or other information allowing us to locate the content on the Services; (iii) your name and email address; and (iv) a statement confirming your bona fide belief that your notification is accurate or complete.

## Notification of Criminal Activity
If we become aware of any information that gives us a good faith belief that a criminal offense involving a threat to the life or safety of a person or persons has taken place, is taking place or is likely to take place, we may notify the appropriate authorities in the applicable EU Member State, as required by the DSA.
