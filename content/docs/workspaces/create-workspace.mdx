When you sign up for NocoDB, a default workspace is automatically created for you. You can choose to [rename this workspace](/docs/product-docs/workspaces/actions-on-workspace#rename-workspace) or create a new one as needed.

This guide walks you through the process of creating a new workspace.

## Create a workspace

1. Hover over the **Workspace icon** in the top-left corner of the minibar to open the **Workspace context menu**.
2. Click **Create workspace**.
3. Enter a name for your workspace.
4. Click **Create Workspace** to complete the process.

Once created, you become the **owner** of the workspace. From here, you can [create tables](/docs/product-docs/tables/create-table) and [invite collaborators](/docs/product-docs/workspaces/workspace-collaboration) to work with you.

* Workspaces support unlimited tables and members.
* Workspace ownership is transferable, but at least one owner must always remain.
