## Find workspace ID
Each workspace in NocoDB has a unique ID (prefixed with `w`, short for *workspace*) that identifies it within the system. You can find the workspace ID in the URL when you are in the workspace.

Example
```
https://app.nocodb.com/#/w1234567890/pqh6trao813gar7
```
In this example, the workspace ID is: `w1234567890`
