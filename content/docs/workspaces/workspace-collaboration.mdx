<Callout type="info">A comprehensive guide regarding roles and permissions can be accessed [here](/docs/product-docs/roles-and-permissions)</Callout>

## Invite Members to Workspace
1. Go to **Team & Settings** in the left minibar.
2. Open the **Members** tab.
3. Click **Add Member**.
4. Enter one or more email addresses (comma-separated).
5. Select a role for the invited member(s).
6. Click **Invite to Workspace**.

<Callout type="info">Any user can invite members to the workspace, but they can only assign a role to new members that is at most equal to their own role.</Callout>

<Callout type="info">You have the capability to invite multiple members simultaneously by entering their email addresses, separated by commas.</Callout>


## Invite Teams to Workspace
NocoDB now allows inviting **Teams** to the workspace for simplified collaboration. Teams can be assigned workspace-level access roles, streamlining permissions for all their members.

1. Navigate to the `Team & Settings` page and open the `Members` tab.
2. Click on the `Add Teams` button.
3. From the dropdown, select one or multiple teams to add.
4. Choose the appropriate access role from the dropdown menu. Note that,
- Similar to individual members, you can only assign roles that are at most equal to your own role in the workspace.
- Teams can't be assigned the **Owner** role.
5. Click on the `Add Teams` button to complete the process.

<Callout type="info">When a team is invited to the workspace, all users under that team inherit the assigned workspace-level role unless overridden by a lower-level permission (explicit workspace role or base-level role).</Callout>

To learn more about creating and managing teams, refer to the [Teams documentation](/docs/product-docs/collaboration/teams).


## List Workspace Members and Teams
The `Members` tab displays all users and teams that have access to the workspace.

- Individual members appear with their email addresses.
- Teams are listed with their name and member count.

<Callout type="info">Members and teams list is accessible to all workspace members.</Callout>

## Modify Roles for Members or Teams
Access permissions for both members and teams can be updated directly from the `Members` tab.

1. Click on the access dropdown next to the member or team.
2. Select a new role from the list of available options.

<Callout type="info">You can only assign roles that are at most equal to your own role in the workspace. Teams cannot be assigned the **Owner** role.</Callout>

## Role Precedence
When a user has multiple role assignments through both team and individual access, NocoDB resolves the final permission using a clear precedence order.

- Individual explicit role takes precedence over team-assigned role.
- Base-level roles override workspace-level roles.
- In case of multiple team roles, the **highest** permission applies.

<Callout type="info">This ensures users always retain the most permissive access assigned at their lowest configured level.</Callout>

To learn more about effective role resolution, refer to the [Teams effective role resolution documentation](/docs/product-docs/collaboration/teams#effective-role-resolution).


## Remove Members or Teams from Workspace
You can remove both members and teams from the workspace using the context menu.

1. Click on the vertical ellipses `⋮` beside the member or team entry.
2. Select the appropriate removal option — `Remove User` or `Remove Team`.

<Callout type="info">Only the workspace **owner** or **creator** can remove members or teams from the workspace.</Callout>

## Best Practice
- Invite all users to the workspace first with the **Inherit** role. This will allow them to access workspaces based on their team or base-level roles.
- Use teams for departments or functional groups to manage roles efficiently.
- Adjust team-level permissions instead of managing roles individually for large workspaces.
