Workspaces in NocoDB help organize and manage your data collaboratively. Each workspace can contain one or more bases, bringing together related tables, views, and other elements under a unified structure. You can control access by assigning roles to workspace members, enabling secure and efficient teamwork.

Start by [creating a workspace](/docs/product-docs/workspaces/create-workspace), then [invite team members](/docs/product-docs/workspaces/workspace-collaboration) to collaborate. You can [change member roles](/docs/product-docs/workspaces/workspace-collaboration#modify-workspace-member-roles) or [remove members](/docs/product-docs/workspaces/workspace-collaboration#remove-workspace-members) as needed. To keep things organized, you can [rename](/docs/product-docs/workspaces/actions-on-workspace#rename-workspace) or [delete](/docs/product-docs/workspaces/actions-on-workspace#delete-workspace) a workspace at any time.

<Callout type="info">In the open-source version of NocoDB, a default workspace is provided. Additional workspaces cannot be created.</Callout>

Located at the top of the minibar, the workspace menu lists all available workspaces. Click a workspace name to switch between them.
