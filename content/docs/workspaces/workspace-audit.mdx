<Callout type="info">
Workspace audit logs are available only in **Enterprise Edition** in both self-hosted & cloud-hosted plans.
</Callout>

The **Audit Logs** feature in NocoDB provides a detailed, time-stamped record of user activity across your workspace. It helps workspace admins track who did what, when, and where — promoting transparency and accountability.

⚠️ Note: This section **excludes** record-level audit logs (such as changes made to individual records). To view those, open a record in expanded view and navigate to the Audit tab. Refer [here](/records/expand-record#record-audit) for more details.

### Accessing Audit Logs

Only workspace owners can access audit logs. To view the audit logs:

1. Navigate to **Team & Settings** in the left side minibar
2. Click on **Audits** tab.

### Understanding Audit Logs

Each log entry displays:

* **User**: Name (if set) & Email of the user who performed the action.
* **Timestamp**: When the action occurred (e.g., “35s ago”, "1h ago").
* **Base**: The base where the action took place. Both base name and ID are shown.
* **Event**: The type of action performed (e.g., *Field Create*, *Field Update*, *Field Rename*).
* **IP Address**: Source IP of the user performing the action.
* **OS, Browser**: Information about the user’s device and browser.

Click on any log entry to view more details about the action, including the specific changes made. Additional details are included in the JSON format, which can be expanded for deeper insights.
