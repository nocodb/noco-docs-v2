##  Why are we building this?
Most internet businesses equip themselves with either spreadsheet or a database to solve their business needs.
Spreadsheets are used by a Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day.
However, we are way off working at similar speeds on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing.
Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings has meant horrible access controls, vendor lockin, data lockin, abrupt price changes
& most importantly a glass ceiling on what's possible in the future.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to provide the most powerful no-code interface for databases which is Open Source to every single internet business in the world.
This would not only democratise access to a powerful computing tool
but also bring forth a billion+ people who will have radical tinkering-and-building abilities on internet.
