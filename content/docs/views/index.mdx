Views in NocoDB allow you to customize how your data is displayed while maintaining independent control over sorting, filtering, and field visibility. Each view retains its own configuration, ensuring that changes made to one view do not affect any others.

This flexibility enables users to organize and visualize data efficiently, providing tailored perspectives for different workflows or team members.

<Callout type="info">A View represents data from a table. Any updates made to records in one view are reflected across all other views of the same table.</Callout>

## View Permission Types

Permissions can be applied to each view. By default, all views are **Collaborative**. To view or modify a view’s permission type, open the **View Toolbar Menu** as shown below.

![Lock / Unlock view](/img/v2/views/lock-view/view-permission-change.png)

<Callout type="info">All views within a base are visible to every member. Only the ability to edit or modify view configurations can be controlled through view permission type settings.</Callout>

View configurations include the following items in the toolbar:
* Field visibility
* Field order
* Field width
* Filters
* Sorts
* Groups
* Row Colors
* Row Height

Toolbar access is determined by the member's role. Members with **Editor**, **Creator**, or **Owner** roles have toolbar access by default. Members with **Commenter** or **Viewer** roles do not have toolbar access.

### Collaborative Views (Default)

By default, views are set to **Collaborative**, allowing members with edit permissions or higher to modify view configurations. In this mode, all members with toolbar access can modify view configurations such as field visibility, order, filters, sorts, groups, colors, and row height.

### Locked Views

In a **Locked View**, view configurations cannot be edited until the view is unlocked. Members can read data but cannot modify view settings or content. This mode is ideal for sharing consistent data presentations with others while preventing accidental changes.

Learn more about [Locking and Unlocking Views](/docs/product-docs/views/actions-on-view#lock--unlock-view).

### Personal Views ☁

<Callout type="note">Personal Views are available in NocoDB Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise editions.</Callout>

**Personal Views** give exclusive control over view configurations to the owner, while other members have read-only access to view configurations. This mode is similar to Locked Views but allows only the view owner to make configuration changes.

* The owner can reassign ownership or convert the view to **Collaborative** or **Locked**.
* The base owner or creator also retains the ability to manage ownership and lock status.
* For older views without an assigned owner, ownership defaults to the base owner.

## General Notes

* When a table is opened, the default view displayed is the first common (non-personal) view, which can be either **Collaborative** or **Locked**.
* Each table must contain at least one common (non-personal) view. The last remaining common view cannot be deleted or converted into a personal view.
* The field display order for linked records is determined by the first common (non-personal) view of the source table.
