Filters help you narrow down and organize data based on specific conditions. NocoDB supports:
    - **Nested filters**: Combine multiple conditions across different fields.
    - **AND / OR logic**: Choose how filters are grouped.

Use filters to focus only on the records that matter to you.

## Add or edit filters

1. Click the **Filter** button in the toolbar.
2. Choose **Add filter** or **Add filter group**.
3. Set up each filter by selecting a **Field**, **Operation**, and (if needed) a **Value**.
4. To refine results further, combine multiple filters using **AND** or **OR** logic.

### Group filters
You can group multiple filters together using a `Filter Group` to build complex, nested conditions. This allows you to combine filters using either `AND` or `OR` logic, enabling more precise control over your data. To create a filter group, click the `Filter` button in the toolbar and choose `+ Add filter group`. Within a group, you can add individual filters or even nest additional groups.

## Filter by current user ☁

<Callout type="info">This feature is available in NocoDB Cloud and NocoDB Enterprise Edition.</Callout>

You can filter records based on the currently logged-in user using the **Current User** option when configuring filters on **User fields** and their derivatives (such as `createdBy` and `updatedBy`). This is especially useful for creating views that show only the records relevant to the user viewing them.

![Filter by Current User](/img/v2/table-operations/current-user.png)

When a dynamic **Current User** filter is applied, the toolbar shows an **@** icon next to the filter count as an indicator.

<Callout type="warning">**Current User** filters do not apply in publicly shared views. If no other filters are present, the shared view will display no records.</Callout>

## Enabling NULL and EMPTY filters

By default, filters like `is null`, `is not null`, `is empty`, and `is not empty` are hidden in the filter menu. To use them explicitly, go to [Base settings](/docs/product-docs/bases/actions-on-base#base-settings) and enable **Show NULL and EMPTY filter**.

Before enabling the setting:

![Show isBlank](/img/v2/table-operations/filter-is-blank.png)

After enabling it, you’ll see additional options like `is null` and `is empty`, which let you filter out cells with `NULL` or empty values.

Alternatively, you can use **is blank** and **is not blank** filters to handle both NULL and EMPTY values in a simplified way.
