The **Fullscreen Mode** button, available in the toolbar, allows you to expand any view area to occupy the entire screen. This helps you focus on your data by hiding navigation menus and other interface elements.

### Enable Fullscreen Mode
To enable fullscreen, click the **Enter Fullscreen** button on the toolbar.

Once activated, the grid view will stretch to cover the entire workspace area.

### Exit Fullscreen Mode
To exit fullscreen, click the **Exit Fullscreen** button that appears in the same position.

This feature is especially useful when working with large datasets, as it maximizes screen space for better visibility and navigation.
