Sorting enables you to arrange your data alphabetically (A → Z) or (Z → A) for text based types and in ascending or descending order for numerical types. NocoDB supports nested sorting, allowing you to select fields and the order in which to apply nested sorting. 

### Add or edit sort

1. Click the `Sort` button in the toolbar menu.
2. Choose the `Field` to sort by.
3. Configure the sorting `Direction` : ascending or descending
4. Use `+ Add Sort Option` to add additional fields for sorting.

### Delete sort

- Click the `Sort` button in the toolbar.
- Click on the trash / bin icon to the right of the sort you wish to delete.
