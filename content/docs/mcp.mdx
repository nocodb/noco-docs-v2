The **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** lets you connect NocoDB with LLMs that support MCP, such as Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf. With this integration, LLMs can interact directly with your NocoDB base to create, query, update, and manage records.

## Desktop LLM Clients

Each MCP endpoint in NocoDB provides a secure URL that can be linked to an MCP-compatible client.
Once configured, the LLM can execute database operations in your workspace through natural language prompts.

MCP server exposes standard CRUD operations. These can be triggered conversationally, without writing SQL or scripts.

| Action | Purpose              | Sample Prompt                                                 |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create | Add new records      | Create a task named ‘Review Documentation’                    |
| Read   | Look up information  | Show me all projects with deadlines this week                 |
| Update | Change existing data | Mark the status of Project X as completed & re-assign to John |
| Delete | Remove records       | Remove all tasks assigned to John                             |

<Callout type="note"> NocoDB MCP supports only record-level operations and does not handle table, field, or other metadata changes. </Callout>

### Server Configuration (NocoDB)

1. Click on the **Overview** button in the left sidebar.
2. Select the **Settings** tab.
3. Select the **Model Context Protocol**
4. Click on the **New MCP Endpoint** to create a new MCP config JSON for your base.
5. Provide a name for the MCP endpoint
6. Click **Create** to generate the MCP Config JSON.
7. Copy the generated JSON configuration. This will be used in your LLM client configuration.

### Client Configuration

#### Claude

1. Open **Claude Desktop Preferences** (`⌘+,`).
2. Under **Develop**, click **Edit Config**.
3. Insert the JSON block copied [here](#server-configuration-nocodb) as `claude_desktop_config.json`.
4. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop.


#### Cursor

1. Go to **Cursor Settings** (`⇧+⌘+J`).
2. Open the **MCP** tab and select **Add Custom MCP**.
3. Paste the JSON block copied [here](#server-configuration-nocodb). Save.

<Callout type="info"> On success, you will see `11 tools enabled` below the MCP Server just installed. If you see an error, double-check the JSON configuration. </Callout>

#### Windsurf

1. Open **Windsurf Settings** (`⌘+,`).
2. In the **Cascade** section > `Plugins (MCP Server)` > Click **Manage Plugins**
3. Paste the JSON block copied [here](#server-configuration-nocodb). Save.

## Web based LLM Clients (OAuth)

Connect NocoDB to web-based LLM applications using OAuth, enabling seamless database access directly from the browser without requiring desktop client setup. This approach grants granular permission controls and eliminates the need for manual JSON configuration.

### Claude Web

OAuth-based integration allows Claude web users to access NocoDB databases through the connectors interface.

#### Setup Steps

1. Click [here](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors) to open Claude Web Settings in a new tab.
    - Alternatively, navigate to **Settings** > **Connectors** from the Claude Web app.
2. Click **Add custom connector**.
![open-connectors](/img/v2/mcp/web-app/claude/open-connectors.png)
3. In the "Add custom connector" dialog:
    - Provide a connector name of your choice
    - Enter the MCP endpoint URL: `https://app.nocodb.com/mcp`
    - Click `Add`
![add-connector-dialog](/img/v2/mcp/web-app/claude/add-connector-dialog.png)
4. NocoDB Connector will now be listed in "Disconnected" state. Click **Connect** to initiate the OAuth authorization flow (Opens in a new tab).
![add-connector](/img/v2/mcp/web-app/claude/connect.png)
5. Authorize Access
    - You will be asked to log in to your NocoDB account (if not already logged in)
    - Select the workspace and base you want to connect
    - Confirm the permissions Claude will have
      - Access the selected base
      - Read / create / update / delete records in the selected base
      - Act on your behalf within the selected resources
    - Click **Authorize** to grant access
![authorize-access](/img/v2/mcp/web-app/claude/authorize-access.png)

With this, the NocoDB connector will move to "Connected" state in Claude Web. You can now interact with your NocoDB data through Claude web application.

<Callout type="note"> On-prem enterprise users should replace https://app.nocodb.com with their NocoDB instance URL</Callout>

#### Configure Tool Permissions
By default, all tools are set to "Always ask permission" to ensure you have control over each operation Claude performs. You can modify these settings as needed.

Click [here](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors) to open Claude Web Settings in a new tab. Click **Configure** on the NocoDB connector to manage tool permissions. Set each tool's permission level using the dropdown menu:

- **Always ask permission** — Your approval is required every time Claude uses this tool
- **Allow unsupervised** — Claude can use this tool without requesting approval

![tool-permissions](/img/v2/mcp/web-app/claude/configure.png)
![tool-permissions](/img/v2/mcp/web-app/claude/tool-permissions.png)

To retrieve Workspace & Base information that this connector has access to, use the "Get Base Info" tool.
![get-base-info](/img/v2/mcp/web-app/claude/get-base-info.png)

#### Using NocoDB Tools in Claude Web

Once configured, you can interact with your NocoDB data conversationally. For example:

- "Show me all projects with deadlines this week"
- "Create a task named 'Review Documentation'"
- "Mark the status of Project X as completed and reassign to John"
- "Provide details of our top 3 sponsors"

Claude will execute these requests using the enabled NocoDB tools, reading from and writing to your database based on the permissions you've granted.

<Callout type="warning">OAuth authorization functions as a set of access credentials granting Claude control over your NocoDB base within the selected workspace. Only authorize access to bases and operations you trust Claude to perform on your behalf.</Callout>

### OpenAI Web

OAuth-based integration allows OpenAI ChatGPT users to access NocoDB databases through the custom actions interface.
