**Last Updated: July 22, 2025**

To support the delivery of our Services, NocoDB Inc. may engage and use data processors with access to certain Customer Data. This page provides important information about the identity, location, and role of each Sub-processor.

Due to the nature of our global business and our ongoing efforts to delight our customers, our business needs and services providers may change from time to time. For example, we may deprecate a service provider to consolidate and minimize our use of service providers. Similarly, we may add a service provider if we believe that doing so will enhance our ability to deliver our Services.
