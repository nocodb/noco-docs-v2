To support the delivery of our Services, NocoDB Inc. may engage and use data processors with access to certain Customer Data. This page provides important information about the identity, location, and role of each Sub-processor.

Due to the nature of our global business and our commitment to continually improving our Services, our business needs and use of service providers may change from time to time. For instance, we may remove a service provider to consolidate operations or add a new service provider to enhance our ability to deliver the Services.

We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed of any updates to our list of Sub-processors. If you would prefer to receive notifications of such updates by email, you may contact us at support@nocodb.com to request subscription to Sub-processor change notifications.
