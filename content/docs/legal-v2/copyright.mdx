## Notifying NocoDB of copyright infringement
NocoDB respects artist and content owner rights, and it is NocoDB policy to respond to alleged infringement notices that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998(“DMCA”), the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.

If you believe that content on an nocodb.com-hosted website (the “Services”) infringes your copyright, please use the process outlined here to notify NocoDB Inc doing business as NocoDB (“NocoDB”) in accordance with the DMCA.

Only copyright owners can report a suspected infringement to NocoDB. If you believe that any content on the Services infringes another party's copyright, you should advise the copyright owner directly.

For your complaint to be valid under the DMCA, you must provide all of the following information in writing:

- An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;

- Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;

- Identification of the content that is claimed to be infringing and where it is located on the Services;

- Information reasonably sufficient to permit NocoDB to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and, e-mail address;

- A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the content in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or law; and

- A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.

The above information must be submitted to NocoDB’s DMCA Agent using the following contact information:

NocoDB Inc,
Attn: DMCA Agent
Address: 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington city, New castle county, Delaware 19801
Email: copyright@nocodb.com

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT ONLINE MATERIAL IS INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY AND CIVIL PENALTIES, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES.

## NocoDB’s Response
After NocoDB receives a proper written notice as described above, NocoDB will expeditiously remove or disable the allegedly-infringing content and notify the user that posted the content, or the owner of the workspace where the content appears.

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, NocoDB has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. In its sole discretion, NocoDB may also limit access to the Services and/or terminate the NocoDB accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

## Counter-Notices
If a user believes that their content was removed or disabled improperly or by mistake, the user may send NocoDB a written counter-notice that includes the following:

- The user’s name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address;

- Identification of the content that has been removed or disabled and where it was located on the Services before it was removed or disabled;

- A statement that: i) the user consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which the user’s address is located (or San Francisco, California, if the user’s address is outside the United States), and ii) the user will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of infringement or an agent of such person. (An example would be: “ I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court with jurisdiction in [person’s city and state of residence or “San Francisco, California”], and I will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of infringement or an agent of such person. ”);

- A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the content in question was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the content to be removed or disabled (i.e., “ I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the content identified by the complainant was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake, or misidentification of the content to be removed or disabled ” or “ I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the content identified by the complainant has been removed or disabled at the URL identified and will no longer be shown ”); and

- The user’s physical or electronic signature.

If the counter-notice is complete and valid, NocoDB will forward the information in the counter-notice to the person that filed the complaint. If the person that filed the complaint does not give NocoDB’s DMCA Agent notice that a valid court action has been filed within 10-14 days, NocoDB may restore the removed or disabled content.

Please note that the preceding requirements do not constitute legal advice.
