b. How do I opt out via self-regulatory programs?
You can opt-out of advertising companies serving interest-based advertising to you by using the self-regulatory program opt-outs below (to the extent those companies participate in such industry opt-out pages).

To opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for web properties or https://youradchoices.com/appchoices for mobile apps.

To opt out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit https://thenai.org/opt-out/.

Opting out via the above mechanisms does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It means that the online ads that you do see from these self-regulatory program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-party opt-out options or programs, or the accuracy of their statements regarding those options or programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under those self-regulatory programs.
