((i) through (iii) collectively, our or the "Services").

### 1.2. Read these Terms Carefully

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION.** BY CREATING AN NOCODB ACCOUNT, CLICKING "SIGN UP", "SIGN UP WITH GOOGLE", "SIGN UP FOR FREE", "SUBMIT", OR THE LIKE INDICATING ACCEPTANCE ELECTRONICALLY, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS IN AN ORDER FORM OR OTHER ORDERING DOCUMENT REFERENCING THESE TERMS, OR BY ACCESSING OR USING NOCODB, WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE A REGISTERED USER OF NOCODB, YOU SIGNIFY THAT:
- (I) YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS

THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN SECTION 14.2 (THE "ARBITRATION AGREEMENT") AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION IN SECTION 14.3 (THE "CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER") THAT REQUIRE, WITH ONLY SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS IN SECTIONS 14.1 AND 14.2 OR UNLESS YOU OPT OUT PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS IN SECTION 14.2, THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS, COLLECTIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.

### 1.3. Organizations

If you are an individual and you access or use our Services on behalf of a company, organization, principal, or other entity, such as your employer (each, together with its affiliates, an "Organization"), then:
- (i) these Terms are an agreement between us and you and us and that Organization
- (ii) you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Organization to these Terms (and if you do not have the authority, you may not access or use our Services)
- (iii) your acceptance of these Terms will bind such Organization to these Terms
- (iv) your individual right to access and use our Services may be suspended or terminated (and ownership and administration of your NocoDB Account (defined below) may be transferred) if you cease to be associated with, or cease to use an email address associated with, owned by, or provisioned by, that Organization
- (v) we may disclose information regarding you and your use of the Services, including Your Content (defined below), to such Organization, or to appropriate individuals associated with that Organization
- (vi) the terms "you" and "your", as used in these Terms, refer to both you and such Organization

If you sign up for our Services using an email address associated with, owned by, or provisioned by an Organization, or if an Organization pays fees due in connection with your access to or use of our Services (or reimburses you for payment of such fees), or otherwise, then we may deem you, in our sole discretion, to be accessing and using our Services on behalf of that Organization. You represent and warrant that all information that you provide to us regarding any Organization on whose behalf you use our Services, including information identifying other users associated with such Organization or email domains owned by such Organization, is and at all times will be truthful, accurate, and complete, and that you will immediately notify us should any such information change or no longer be truthful, accurate, or complete.

If you are an Organization on whose behalf an individual user is accessing or using our Services as described above, then you are responsible for the acts and omissions of all such individual users, and for ensuring that all such individual users comply with these Terms.

If you are an individual user and are a member of, or have access to workspaces within the Services that are part of, an account that is not subject to these Terms as explicitly stated in an agreement governing such account (such as an Enterprise, or Business plan account governed by a separate master subscription agreement), then these Terms govern your access to and use of the Services outside of such account and in any other workspace to which you have access or as to which you are an owner, collaborator, or member.

## 2. Our Services

### 2.1. Eligibility

You may use our Services only if you can form a legally binding contract with us (and on behalf of your Organization as applicable), and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. To use our Services, you must be at least 16 years old, and in some circumstances even older (please check your local law for the age of digital consent). You represent and warrant that you meet the applicable age requirements and are competent to agree to these Terms, or, if you are unable to form a binding contract under applicable law, you represent and warrant that you have your parent's or legal guardian's permission to use our Services, and that your parent or legal guardian is agreeing to these Terms concurrently. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user of our Services who is unable to form a binding contract under applicable law, you are agreeing to these Terms and you are responsible for such user's activity on our Services. Our Services are not available to any users who were previously removed from the Services, unless our duly authorized representative agrees otherwise in writing.

### 2.2. Access, Restrictions, and Acceptable Use

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you may access and use our Services during the Subscription Term (defined below), except as may be limited by your Organization. Except as we otherwise agree in writing or to the extent a restriction is prohibited by law, you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy, as updated from time to time, which is available at [www.nocodb.com/aup](/docs/product-docs/legal-v2/acceptable-use-policy) and is incorporated into these Terms by reference ("Acceptable Use Policy").

### 2.3. NocoDB Accounts

Your account on our Services (your "NocoDB Account") gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time. We may maintain different types of NocoDB Accounts for different types of users. You acknowledge and agree that you do not own your NocoDB Account.

You may not use another user's NocoDB Account without such user's permission. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your NocoDB Account, and you must keep your NocoDB Account password(s) strong and secure. You should notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your NocoDB Account. Any individual with administrator-level access to your NocoDB Account can modify your NocoDB Account settings, access, and billing information. We will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your NocoDB Account, or for any changes to your NocoDB Account, including your ability to access your NocoDB Account or Your Content (defined below), made by any individual with administrator-level access to your NocoDB Account.

You can remove Your Content from your NocoDB Account by deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of Your Content may not be completely removed. We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of any of Your Content, or any failure to remove or delete such content.

### 2.5. Usage Data

We may collect and analyze data and other information regarding your use of the Services, including access, usage patterns, and performance (collectively, "Usage Data"). We are free at any time (including after termination of these Terms) to use such data and information for our business purposes, including but not limited to analytics, quality assurance, product and service development and improvement, and churn rate and service level analysis. For clarity, Usage Data does not include Your Content.

### 2.6. Software

To the extent you receive our Software, subject to your compliance with these Terms, during the applicable Subscription Term, we grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right and license to use our Software solely as reasonably necessary for your use of our Services in accordance with these Terms.

### 2.7. Service Changes, Suspension, and Termination

We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to our Services without notice or liability, without cause or for any reason, including if in our sole discretion you violate any provision of these Terms. Upon termination, you continue to be bound by these Terms.

### 2.8. Product Trials

In our sole discretion, we may make available to you certain product features on a trial basis, and such trial may be designated by us as an alpha, a beta, a pilot, a limited release, a limited availability, a test period, a preview, or an evaluation, or using another similar term ("Product Trial"). You may participate in any Product Trial, subject to these Terms and any additional terms and conditions made available by us. You acknowledge that product features made available to you as part of a Product Trial ("Trial Features") might contain bugs, errors, or omissions. **TRIAL FEATURES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY, ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, OR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.** Trial Features are not subject to any service level agreements or support commitments. Trial Features are Confidential Information (defined below). They might never be made available for general use or otherwise be provided in a future version of our Services, and we may discontinue Trial Features, or revoke your access to Trial Features, at any time for any or no reason, in our sole discretion, without any liability to you. Discontinuing Trial Features, or making Trial Features inaccessible to you, may have the effect of making some or all of Your Content inaccessible to you.

## 5. Charges and Payment

### 5.1. Subscription Plans

We may offer plans that you may sign up for that allow you to use certain aspects of our Services, either for free or for a fee (a "Subscription Plan"). We may change Subscription Plans, including by offering new services or features for additional fees and charges or by adding or amending fees and charges for existing Subscription Plans, in our sole discretion. Any change to a Subscription Plan's pricing or payment terms will become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in these Terms. Subscription Plans may set allotments for use of designated Services aspects. Use of Services aspects in excess of a Subscription Plan's designated allotment may result in (additional) fees, and such fees will be included in a true-up invoice or charged automatically via the payment method associated with your NocoDB Account ("Payment Method").

### 5.2. Billing and Payment

For any paid Subscription Plan, you agree to make payments, and we may automatically charge your Payment Method, as described below, for so long as your NocoDB Account remains active. Subscription Plans may be offered for a set subscription period (each such period, a "Subscription Term"). If you elect to sign up for a paid Subscription Plan, you agree to the pricing and payment terms specified at checkout, at www.nocodb.com/pricing, or as otherwise posted or communicated to you, as we may update them from time to time.

You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted Payment Method. When you initiate a purchase transaction, you authorize us to provide your payment information to third parties so we can complete your transaction and to charge your Payment Method, in United States Dollars, for the type of transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) and any applicable recurring charges as described below. You will pay applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such transaction, and are also responsible for any payment-related fees such as wire transfer fees, credit card processing fees, and foreign transaction fees.

We currently use Stripe as our third-party service provider for payment services, and by using our Services you agree to be bound by Stripe's Services Agreement, currently available at https://stripe.com/us/legal. If your payment is not successfully settled for any reason, you remain responsible for any amounts not remitted to us, and you authorize us or our third-party service provider to continue to charge your Payment Method, without further notice, until such time as your payment is settled. All payments for transactions are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms.

### 5.3. Renewals

Your subscription continues until canceled by you or we terminate your access to or use of our Services in accordance with these Terms. Unless and until canceled by you, all Subscription Plans will automatically renew for renewal terms equal in length to the original Subscription Term, at the applicable price as of the renewal date. If you do not want a Subscription Plan to renew, you must cancel it before the end of the Subscription Term via the Account Settings or Workspace Settings page on your NocoDB Account). If you purchase a Subscription Plan, we (or our third-party service provider) will automatically charge you each year or month, as applicable, on the anniversary of the commencement of your subscription, using the payment information you have provided, until you cancel your subscription. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription Plan, you acknowledge that your Subscription Plan has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your subscription by you or us.

### 5.4. Cancellations and Terminations

If we cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, except in the event of your breach of these Terms or failure to pay fees when due, we will grant you a prorated refund for the remaining unused portion of your Subscription Term. If you cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, your right to use our Services will continue until the end of your then-current Subscription Term and then terminate without further charges. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you live in the European Union or Turkey and cancel your Subscription Plan within fourteen (14) days of purchase, you will be eligible for a refund of any payments made for the canceled Subscription Term, and, if you request such a refund, your right to use our Services will terminate immediately upon cancellation of your subscription. Subject to the preceding sentence, if you cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, unless required by law, **YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF ANY FEES PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION.**

### 5.5. Late Payments

Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less (plus the costs of collection).

### 5.6. Credits

Any credits that may accrue to your NocoDB Account (for example, as a result of a promotion or referral program, or a Subscription Plan downgrade) will expire one year following their accrual, or upon expiration or termination of your NocoDB Account, whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any credits accrued to a workspace on a free Subscription Plan will expire if the workspace's Subscription Plan is not upgraded to a paid Subscription Plan within ninety (90) days of accrual, unless otherwise specified. Credits have no currency or exchange value, and are not transferable or refundable.

The Receiving Party shall: (i) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially-reasonable degree of care; (ii) only use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, and only permit it to be accessed or used, for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under these Terms, for the purpose of exploring a business relationship (or changes to the business relationship) between the parties, or for any other purpose consistent with our Privacy Policy; and (iii) not disclose any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Receiving Party's service providers or financial/legal advisors who need to know the Confidential Information and are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in these Terms.

### 13.3. Compelled Access or Disclosure
If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, then, prior to making such disclosure (unless prohibited by law or legal process) it shall use commercially-reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.

### 13.4. Injunctive Relief
Each of the parties to these Terms acknowledges that the other party will be irreparably harmed if Confidential Information of the other is distributed in breach of this Section, and that such other party would not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of such an actual or threatened breach. Therefore, each of the parties agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any actual or threatened breaches of this Section by the other party without the necessity of showing actual damages or showing that monetary damages would not afford an adequate remedy.

## 14. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
### 14.1. Governing Law
You agree that: (i) we will be deemed solely domiciled in the State of California; and (ii) our Services will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.

The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 14.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is determined not to apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

### 14.2. Arbitration
READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This section 14.2 (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of our Services, including receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from us; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using our Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a user or consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.

If you are a new user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at legal@nocodb.com with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.

For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at legal@nocodb.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim through binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or San Francisco, California, unless you and we agree otherwise. If you are using our Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using our Services for non-commercial purposes: (a) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (b) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (c) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory or any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.

NOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.

IF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO BE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL PROVISION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL BE SEVERED. SEVERANCE OF THE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL PROVISION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH SHALL REMAIN IN FORCE, OR THE PARTIES’ ABILITY TO COMPEL ARBITRATION OF ANY REMAINING CLAIMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS PURSUANT TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF THE CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER IS FOUND TO BE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BECAUSE IT WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM SEEKING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THEN ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE ENTITLEMENT TO SUCH RELIEF (AND ONLY THAT RELIEF) MUST BE SEVERED FROM ARBITRATION AND MAY BE LITIGATED IN A CIVIL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. ALL OTHER CLAIMS FOR RELIEF SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE ARBITRATED UNDER ITS TERMS, AND THE PARTIES AGREE THAT LITIGATION OF ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE ENTITLEMENT TO PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHALL BE STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF ANY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION.

### 14.3. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED OUR SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
