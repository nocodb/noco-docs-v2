It also includes information you provide when connecting a third-party account, product, or service to the Services. You (and anyone who can interact with your use of the Services) own and control the nature of any Content, subject to any applicable terms and conditions including our [Terms of Service](/docs/product-docs/legal-v2/terms-of-service) and this Privacy Policy. Our collection, use, and disclosure practices with respect to Content are distinct from those with respect to other sorts of information, as explained in [Section 2.a](#a-use-of-content). below.

We may upload Content automatically with your authorization from third-party services (such as from your Google Drive). See [Section 1.c](#c-third-party-integrations). below.

### b. Customer Information

"Customer Information" consists of information related to your access or use of our Services, the creation of accounts, or that otherwise identifies you as a customer or end user of the Services. Customer Information includes:

- **Identifiers.** This includes your name, mailing address, email address, postal code, telephone number, and other similar identifiers.

If you are an end user using the Services through an account created on your behalf by another of our customers (such as an employer, an organization of which you are a member, or another individual that uses our Services), we may collect and process Customer Information about you on behalf of the customer with whom your use of the Services is associated.

### c. Third-Party Integrations

If you create your account using a service provided by a third party such as Google or Apple, or a single-sign-on service provided by a third party such as Okta, we may collect Customer Information about you from the third-party service (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service). If you create your account using such a third-party service, or if you give us permission by changing the settings on your NocoDB Account, we may also collect, and you authorize us to collect, information about your personal contacts as may be stored within that third-party service, which we may use to facilitate your invitation of collaborators to our Services. By choosing to create an account using a third-party service, you also authorize us to collect Customer Information necessary to authenticate your account with the third party.

Certain aspects of the Services allow you to link or integrate third-party products and services to enable certain features and functionalities with the Services. For example, you can connect your Google Drive account to generate Content in the Services from information and data contained in your Google Drive or integrate with third-party services using our applications or extensions. If you choose to use these features or functionalities, you may be asked to create an account with a third party that provides such features or functionalities or link your existing third-party service account with the Services (and, by doing so, agree to the privacy policy and/or terms and conditions of that third party). You may also be asked to authorize the Services to collect information from the third party on your behalf. We will then collect information (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service) from you and/or that third party as necessary to enable the Services to access your data and content stored with that third-party service. Once the authentication is complete, we have the ability to access information you provided to us or was otherwise collected by the third-party service in accordance with the privacy practices of that third party. We will store the information and data we collect and associate it with your NocoDB Account, and we will use that information and data to enable the integration of the Services with the third-party service and to perform actions requested or initiated by you, or that are reasonably necessary to carry out instructions provided by you.

### d. Automatically-Collected Information

We collect information about how you use the Services and your actions on the Services, including your IP addresses, browser types, operating systems, ISPs, platform types, device types, and mobile device identifiers such as make and model, and mobile carrier. We may also use tools, including third-party tools, to collect analytics data. Some of this information is collected through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, session replay scripts, and similar technologies. Please see our [Cookie Policy](/docs/product-docs/legal-v2/cookie-policy) for more information about our use of cookies and similar tracking technologies.

## 2. How We Use the Information We Collect

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that we may retain, take possession of, delete, or deny you access to your Content if we believe, in our sole discretion, that some or all of your Content, or your use of the Services, violates our [Terms of Service](/docs/product-docs/legal-v2/terms-of-service). We also may analyze metadata related to Content (such as total number of records, file size, API volume, access logs, etc.).
