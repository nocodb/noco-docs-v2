2.2. NocoDB hereby certifies that it understands the restrictions and obligations set forth in this DPA in relation to its role as a Processor and Service Provider, and that it will comply with them.

## 3. Customer’s Instructions to NocoDB

3.1. Purpose Limitation. NocoDB will not (a) sell or share (as defined by CCPA) Customer Personal Data, (b) Process Customer Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purposes set forth in the Agreement, and as specifically stated in Exhibit A, (c) retain, use, or disclose any such data outside of the direct business relationship between the Parties, (d) combine any Customer Personal Data with personal information that it receives from, or on behalf of, another person or persons, or collects from its own interaction with a consumer, except as otherwise permitted by Applicable Law, or (e) otherwise engage in any Processing of Customer Personal Data beyond that in which a Processor may engage under the Applicable Law or in which a Service Provider may engage under the Applicable Law, unless obligated to do otherwise by Applicable Law. In such a case, NocoDB will inform Customer of the applicable legal obligation before engaging in the Processing, unless legally prohibited from doing so. Further details regarding NocoDB’s Processing operations are set forth in Exhibit A. To the extent Customer discloses or makes available deidentified data (as such term is defined under Applicable Law) within the Customer Data to NocoDB, NocoDB shall not attempt to re-identify such data.

3.2. Lawful Instructions. Customer will not instruct NocoDB to Process Customer Personal Data in violation of Applicable Law. NocoDB will without undue delay inform Customer if, in NocoDB’s opinion, an instruction from Customer infringes Applicable Law. The Agreement, including this DPA, constitutes Customer’s complete and final instructions to NocoDB regarding the Processing of Customer Personal Data, including for purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses. Customer shall also have the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop or remediate any unauthorized Processing of Customer Personal Data by NocoDB.

## 4. Limitations on Disclosure

NocoDB will not disclose Customer Personal Data to any third party without first obtaining Customer’s written consent, except as provided in Section 5 (Subcontracting), Section 7 (Responding to Individuals Exercising Their Rights Under Applicable Law) or Section 9 (Data Transfers), except as required by law. NocoDB will require all employees, contractors, and agents who Process Customer Personal Data on NocoDB’s behalf to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data and to comply with the other relevant requirements of this DPA.

## 5. Subcontracting

5.1. Sub-Processors. NocoDB may subcontract the collection or other Processing of Customer Personal Data only in compliance with Applicable Law and any additional conditions for subcontracting set forth in the Agreement. Customer acknowledges and agrees that NocoDB’s Affiliates and certain third parties may be retained as sub-processors to Process Customer Personal Data on NocoDB’s behalf (under this DPA as well as under the Standard Contractual Clauses, if they apply) in order to provide the Services. NocoDB’s third-party sub-processors are listed at https://www.nocodb.com/subprocessors (the “Sub-processor List”). Prior to a sub-processor’s Processing of Customer Personal Data, NocoDB will impose contractual obligations on the sub-processor substantially the same as those imposed on NocoDB under this DPA to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such sub-processor. NocoDB remains liable for its sub-processors’ performance under this DPA to the same extent NocoDB is liable for its own performance.

5.2. Notification. NocoDB will provide Customers with at least ten (10) days’ written notice of new sub-processors before authorizing such sub-processor(s) to Process Customer Personal Data in connection with the provision of the Services. NocoDB will notify Customer at the email address provided in the signature block of this DPA for purposes of this notification. The sub-processor agreements to be provided under Clause 5(j) of the EU SCCs may have all commercial information, or provisions unrelated to the EU SCCs, redacted prior to sharing with Customer, and Customer agrees that such copies will be provided only upon written request.

5.3. Right to Object. Customer may object to NocoDB’s use of a new sub-processor on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Customer Personal Data by notifying NocoDB promptly in writing at legal@nocodb.com within ten (10) business days after receipt of NocoDB’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set out in Section 5.2. In its notification, Customer will explain its reasonable grounds for objection. In the event Customer objects to a new sub-processor, NocoDB will use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Customer Personal Data by the objected-to new sub-processor without unreasonably burdening Customer. If NocoDB is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which will not exceed thirty (30) days, either Party may terminate without penalty the Processing of Customer Personal Data and/or the Agreement with respect only to those services which cannot be provided by NocoDB without the use of the objected-to new sub-processor by providing written notice to the other Party.

## 6. Assistance & Cooperation

6.1. Security. NocoDB will provide reasonable assistance to Customer regarding Customer’s compliance with its security obligations under Applicable Law relevant to NocoDB’s role in Processing Customer Personal Data, taking into account the nature of Processing and the information available to NocoDB, by implementing the technical and organizational measures set forth, without prejudice to NocoDB’s right to make future replacements or updates to the measures that do not materially lower the level of protection of Customer Personal Data. NocoDB will ensure that the persons NocoDB authorizes to Process the Customer Personal Data are subject to written confidentiality agreements or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality no less protective than the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement.

6.2. Personal Data Breach Notification & Response. NocoDB will comply with the Personal Data Breach-related obligations directly applicable to it under Applicable Law. Taking into account the nature of Processing and the information available to NocoDB, NocoDB will inform Customer of a substantiated Personal Data Breach without undue delay or within the time period required under Applicable Law, and in any event no later than seventy-two (72) hours following such substantiation. NocoDB will notify Customer at the email address provided in the signature block of this DPA for purposes of Personal Data Breach notifications. Any such notification is not an acknowledgement of fault or responsibility. This notification will include NocoDB’s then-current assessment of the following information, to the extent available, which may be based on incomplete information:

- the nature of the Personal Data Breach, including, where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of Customer Personal Data records concerned;

- the likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach; and

- measures taken or proposed to be taken by NocoDB to address the Personal Data Breach, including, where applicable, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

NocoDB will provide timely and periodic updates to Customer as additional information regarding the Personal Data Breach becomes available. Customer is solely responsible for complying with legal requirements for incident notification applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third-party notification obligations related to any Personal Data Breach. Nothing in this DPA or in the Standard Contractual Clauses will be construed to require NocoDB to violate, or delay compliance with, any legal obligation it may have with respect to a Personal Data Breach or other security incidents generally.

## 7. Data Subject Requests

To the extent legally permitted, NocoDB will without undue delay notify Customer if NocoDB receives any request from an individual seeking to exercise any right afforded to them under Applicable Law regarding their Personal Data (a “Data Subject Request”). To the extent Customer, in its use of the Services, does not have the ability to address a Data Subject Request, NocoDB will, upon Customer’s request, take commercially reasonable efforts to assist Customer in responding to such Data Subject Request, to the extent NocoDB is legally permitted to do so and the response to such Data Subject Request is required under Applicable Law.

## 8. DPIAs and Consultation with Supervisory Authorities or other Regulatory Authorities
Upon Customer’s written request, NocoDB will provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance as needed and appropriate to fulfill Customer’s obligations under Applicable Law to carry out a data protection impact assessment related to Customer’s use of the Services. NocoDB will provide reasonable assistance to Customer in the cooperation or prior consultation with the Supervisory Authority (as defined under the GDPR) in the performance of its tasks relating to the data protection impact assessment, and to the extent required under the Applicable Law.

## 9. International Data Transfers

9.1. Customer authorizes NocoDB and its sub-processors to make international transfers of the Customer Personal Data in accordance with this DPA so long as Applicable Law for such transfers is respected.

9.2. With respect to Customer Personal Data transferred from the EEA, the EU SCCs will apply and form part of this DPA, unless the European Commission issues updates to the EU SCCs, in which case the updated EU SCCs will control. Undefined capitalized terms used in this provision will have the meanings given to them (or their functional equivalents) in the definitions in the EU SCCs. For purposes of the EU SCCs, they will be deemed completed as follows:

- Where Customer acts as a Controller and NocoDB acts as Customer's Processor with respect to Customer Personal Data subject to the EU SCCs, Module 2 applies.

- Where Customer acts as a Processor and NocoDB acts as Customer's sub-processor with respect to Customer Personal Data subject to the EU SCCs, Module 3 applies.

- Clause 7 (the optional docking clause) is not included.

- Under Clause 9 (Use of sub-processors), the Parties select Option 2 (General written authorization). The initial list of sub-processors is set forth at https://www.nocodb.com/subprocessors. NocoDB will provide notice of updates to that list at least ten (10) business days in advance of any intended additions or replacements of sub-processors, in accordance with Section 5 of this DPA.

- Under Clause 11 (Redress), the optional requirement that data subjects be permitted to lodge a complaint with an independent dispute resolution body is inapplicable.

- Under Clause 17 (Governing law), the Parties select Option 1 (the law of an EU Member State that allows for third-party beneficiary rights). The Parties select the law of Ireland.

- Under Clause 18 (Choice of forum and jurisdiction), the Parties select the courts of Ireland.

- Annexes I and II of the EU SCCs are set forth in Exhibit A below.

- Annex III of the EU SCCs (List of sub-processors) is inapplicable.

- By entering into this DPA, the Parties are deemed to be signing the EU SCCs.

9.3. With respect to Customer Personal Data transferred from the United Kingdom for which the law of the United Kingdom (and not the law in any European Economic Area jurisdiction) governs the international nature of the transfer, the UK SCCs form part of this DPA and take precedence over the rest of this DPA as set forth in the UK SCCs, unless the United Kingdom issues updates to the UK SCCs, in which case the updated UK SCCs will control. Undefined capitalized terms used in this provision will have the meanings given to them (or their functional equivalents) in the definitions in the UK SCCs. For purposes of the UK SCCs, they will be deemed completed as follows:

- Table 1 of the UK SCCs:

    - The Parties’ details are the Parties and their affiliates to the extent any of them is involved in such transfer, including those set forth in Exhibit A.

    - The Key Contacts are the contacts set forth in Exhibit A.

- Table 2 of the UK SCCs: The Approved EU SCCs referenced in Table 2 are the EU SCCs as executed by the Parties pursuant to this Addendum.

- Table 3 of the UK SCCs: Annex 1A, 1B, and II are set forth in Exhibit A.

- Table 4 of the UK SCCs: Either Party may terminate this Addendum as set forth in Section 19 of the UK SCCs.

- By entering into this DPA, the Parties are deemed to be signing the UK SCCs and their applicable Tables and Appendix Information.

9.4. With respect to Customer Personal Data transferred from Switzerland for which Swiss law (and not the law in any European Economic Area jurisdiction) governs the international nature of the transfer, the EU SCCs will apply and will be deemed to have the following differences to the extent required by the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (“FADP”):

- References to the GDPR in the EU SCCs are to be understood as references to the FADP insofar as the data transfers are subject exclusively to the FADP and not to the GDPR.

- The term “member state” in the EU SCCs will not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude data subjects in Switzerland from the possibility of suing for their rights in their place of habitual residence (Switzerland) in accordance with Clause 18(c) of the EU SCCs.

- References to Personal Data in the EU SCCs also refer to data about identifiable legal entities until the entry into force of revisions to the FADP that eliminate this broader scope.

- Under Annex I(C) of the EU SCCs (Competent supervisory authority): where the transfer is subject exclusively to the FADP and not the GDPR, the supervisory authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, and where the transfer is subject to both the FADP and the GDPR, the supervisory authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner insofar as the transfer is governed by the FADP, and the supervisory authority is as set forth in the EU SCCs insofar as the transfer is governed by the GDPR.

## 10. Audits

NocoDB will allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Customer or another auditor mandated by Customer subject to the following conditions: so long as the Agreement remains in effect, Customer may request that NocoDB provide it with NocoDB’s most recent SOC II Type II reports (“Records”) no more than once annually relating to NocoDB’s compliance with this DPA (an “Audit”). To the extent Customer uses a third-party representative at Customer’s sole expense to conduct the Audit, Customer will ensure that such third-party representative is bound by obligations of confidentiality no less protective than those contained in the Agreement. Customer will provide NocoDB with ninety (90) business days prior written notice of its intention to conduct an Audit. Customer will conduct the Audit in a manner that will result in minimal disruption to NocoDB’s business operations and such Audit will take no longer than two (2) business days. Further, Customer will not be entitled to receive data or information of other customers of NocoDB or any other Confidential Information of NocoDB that is not directly relevant for the authorized purposes of the Audit.

## 11. Legal Process

If NocoDB is legally compelled by a court or other government authority to disclose Customer Personal Data, then to the extent permitted by law, NocoDB will promptly provide Customer with sufficient notice of all available details of the legal requirement and reasonably cooperate with Customer’s efforts to challenge the disclosure, seek an appropriate protective order, or pursue such other legal action, as NocoDB deems appropriate.

## 12. Destruction of Personal Data

Upon termination of the Agreement and written request from Customer, NocoDB will delete or anonymize Customer Personal Data, unless prohibited by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will oblige NocoDB to delete or anonymize Customer Personal Data from files created for security, backup and business continuity purposes sooner than required by NocoDB’s data retention processes. Any Customer Personal Data that may be retained beyond the duration of the Agreement will still be protected in accordance with this DPA and NocoDB shall not process such Customer Personal Data except as strictly permitted under Applicable Law.

## 13. Applicability and Order of Precedence

This DPA replaces any existing data processing addendum the Parties may have previously entered into in connection with the Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Agreement and this DPA, the terms of the DPA will apply. In the event of a conflict between this DPA and the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses will apply.
