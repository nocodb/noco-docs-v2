This guide will help you migrate from the OSS to the Enterprise Edition of NocoDB.
Migration is supported for both **On-prem** and **Cloud** setups.

## Prerequisites

- You have the OSS version of NocoDB installed (referred to as **Instance-1**).
- You have the Enterprise Edition of NocoDB installed (referred to as **Instance-2**) — either on-prem or hosted on NocoDB Cloud.
- If On-prem, make sure Enterprise Edition is running on **v0.262.2 or higher**.
- You have admin access to both instances.

<Callout type="info"> On-Prem Enterprise Edition (Instance-2), if option **enable OSS to Enterprise migration** isn't visible, enable from the "Feature preview" section.
    → See [Enable OSS to Enterprise Migration](#enable-oss-to-enterprise-migration).</Callout>

## Steps

The migration process involves two parts:

### Part 1: Generate Migration URL

On the Enterprise Edition (**Instance-2**) — On-prem or Cloud:

1. Click on **Import Data** from the base homepage.
2. Choose **NocoDB** as the datasource.
3. Click on **Generate & Copy URL**.
4. The URL is copied to your clipboard. The modal will now enter **listening mode**, awaiting the migration trigger from OSS.

That’s it! Your base will now be migrated to the Enterprise Edition of NocoDB.
A popup on Instance-1 will show the migration status, and a confirmation message will appear on Instance-2's base homepage.

Click on **Go to Base** to open the migrated base.
