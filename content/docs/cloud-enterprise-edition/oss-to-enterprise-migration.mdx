This guide outlines the steps to migrate from the OSS version of NocoDB to the Enterprise Edition. Migration is supported for both **on-prem** and **cloud** deployments.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following:

- The OSS version of NocoDB (`Instance-1`) is accessible.
- You have access to the Enterprise Edition of NocoDB (`Instance-2`) â€” either self-hosted (on-prem) or provisioned via a cloud subscription on NocoDB.
    - If using the self-hosted (on-prem) Enterprise Edition, it must be running version v0.262.2 or higher.
- You have administrative access to both instances.

## Steps

The migration process consists of two parts:

### Part 1: Generate Migration URL

On the Enterprise Edition (**Instance-2**)

1. On the base homepage, click **Import Data**.
2. Choose **NocoDB** as the data source.
3. Click **Generate & Copy URL**.
4. The URL will be copied to your clipboard. The modal will now enter **listening mode**, waiting for a migration request from the OSS instance.

### Part 2: Migrate Base from Self hosted instance

On the OSS instance (**Instance-1**):
1. Open the base context menu and select **Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Migrate** tab.
3. Paste the migration URL copied from Instance-2.
4. Click **Migrate**.

Once the migration is triggered, a status popup will appear on the OSS instance (Instance-1). Upon successful completion, a confirmation message will be displayed on the Enterprise Edition (Instance-2).

Click **Go to Base** to access the migrated base.
