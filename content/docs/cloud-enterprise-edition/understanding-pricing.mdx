## Understanding User Roles and Billing

### Billable vs. Non-Billable Users

**Billable Users (Editors):** Team members who can create, modify, or delete data
- **Owner:** Full administrative control
- **Creator:** Can create new bases and modify data
- **Editor:** Can modify existing data and records

**Non-Billable Users (Always Free):** Team members with view-only or limited access
- **Commenter:** Can view records and add comments, but cannot edit data
- **Viewer:** Read-only access to data and dashboards

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Maximize your investment by assigning Commenter or Viewer roles to stakeholders who only need to review data, not edit it.

## The "Pay for 9, Get Unlimited" Model

**How It Works**

1. **You pay for only the first 9 editor seats** - regardless of your actual number of editors
2. **Every editor beyond the 9th is completely free** - no limits, no restrictions
3. **Start with any number** - begin with 1-2 users and grow naturally
4. **Automatic billing cap** - NocoDB stops charging after the 9th editor

### Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Your company has 45 total users across different departments

- **25 editors** (Sales, Operations, Product teams who need to update data)
- **20 commenters/viewers** (Executives, stakeholders who review reports)

**What you pay for:**
- Only 9 editor seats (not all 25 editors)
- 0 seats for commenters/viewers

**Your cost:** Same as a 9-person team, but with 45 people using the platform.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I change user roles after setup?
Yes, you can promote Commenters to Editors or vice versa at any time. Billing adjusts automatically based on your current editor count (up to 9 paid seats).

### What happens if I temporarily need more than 9 editors?
Nothing changes with your billing. Add as many editors as needed - you'll still only pay for 9 seats.

### Do I need to commit to 9 seats upfront?
No. Start with the number of editors you need today. You'll only pay for active editor seats until you reach 9.

### How does annual vs. monthly billing work?
Annual billing provides the pricing shown above and helps you save 20% compared to monthly billing.
