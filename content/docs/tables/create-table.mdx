## Creating table Using AI

<Callout type="info">This feature is available only on NocoDB Cloud. It is not supported in self-hosted or on-premise deployments.</Callout>

NocoAI can provide a set of suggested tables based on your current schema and context. The tables thus created will include relevant fields and will be linked to existing tables where applicable. This allows you to quickly expand your database structure without manually defining each table and its relationships.
