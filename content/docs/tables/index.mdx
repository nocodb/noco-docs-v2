Tables are where your data lives in NocoDB — made up of **records** (rows) and **fields** (columns). Each base can have multiple tables, and you can link them to create relationships between datasets.

NocoDB tables function like spreadsheets, with added flexibility:
- View data as a grid, kanban board, gallery, or calendar.
- Perform operations like sorting, filtering, and aggregation.

You can:
- [Create a new table](/docs/product-docs/tables/create-table)
- [Import a table from CSV, Excel, or JSON](/docs/product-docs/tables/create-table-via-import)
- [Import data into an existing table](/docs/product-docs/tables/import-data-into-existing-table)
- [Rename](/docs/product-docs/tables/actions-on-table#rename-table), [duplicate](/docs/product-docs/tables/actions-on-table#duplicate-table), or [delete a table](/docs/product-docs/tables/actions-on-table#delete-table)

Use tables to organize your data your way — flexible, powerful, and easy to manage.
