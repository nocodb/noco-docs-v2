### Importing file data

1. Select file to upload

    There are two ways to upload source file:
    - **Upload** : Upload from local directory. Either click 'browse file' or drag and drop file.
    - **Add from URL** : Specify the URL of the file.
2. (_optional_) Select character encoding. By default, it is set to `UTF-8`.
3. Advanced Settings : **Use first record as header**
   - Enabled by default. If selected, the first record in the spreadsheet will be treated as the header record and its contents will be used as field names.
4. Click on `Upload files` button.
5. **Mapping Fields** (Optional)
    - You can reconfigure the mapping by utilizing the dropdown menu that appears when you click on the destination field.
    - Existing field names are listed under **NocoDB field** (column to the right), while new fields identified from the import file are listed under **Field** (column to the left).
    - NocoDB automatically maps field names in the import file based on the NocoDB field names.
6. **Exclude fields** (Optional)
    - Uncheck checkbox to exclude a field from being imported.
7. **Allow create missing select field options** (Optional)
    - If enabled, NocoDB will create new options for select fields that are not already present in the table.
