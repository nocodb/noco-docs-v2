## Developer features

### Base settings
Some general configurations are available for you to modify within the base settings.
1. **Show M2M tables**: Toggle this option to display/hide M2M tables within the left sidebar. Many-to-many relation is supported via a junction table & is hidden by default.
2. **Show NULL in cells**: Toggle this option to display/hide NULL values within the cells of the table. This helps differentiate against cells holding EMPTY string.
3. **Show NULL & Empty in Filters**: Enable 'additional' filters to differentiate fields containing NULL & Empty Strings. Default support for Blank treats both NULL & Empty strings alike.

To configure base settings, you can follow these steps:

1. Open [Base context menu](#base-context-menu).
2. From dropdown, select `Settings` option.
