In NocoDB, a base is the core structure where your data lives. It contains tables, views, forms, webhooks, and more—offering a complete environment for organizing and collaborating on data. Each base belongs to a specific workspace and cannot be moved across workspaces.

The person who creates a base becomes its **owner**, and a base must always have at least one owner. Ownership can be shared, with multiple owners having full control over base settings and permissions.

### Base-level Permissions

Each base has its own set of members and permissions, independent of workspace-level access. This allows fine-grained control over who can view or edit content within a base.

* You can invite unlimited members.
* Each base can contain unlimited tables.
* Base owners can override inherited workspace permissions.

To get started:

* [Create an empty base](/docs/product-docs/bases/create-base) to build from scratch.
* [Import an Airtable base](/docs/product-docs/bases/import-base-from-airtable) if you're migrating.
* [Invite your team](/docs/product-docs/bases/base-collaboration) to collaborate.
* [Share your base publicly](/docs/product-docs/bases/share-base) if needed.
* [Rename](/docs/product-docs/bases/actions-on-base#rename-base), [bookmark](/docs/product-docs/bases/actions-on-base#star-base), or [delete](/docs/product-docs/bases/actions-on-base#delete-base) it as required.

## Base Dashboard

The **Base Dashboard** is your landing page for each base, giving you a quick overview and access to its core features. To open it, click on the `Overview` button in the left sidebar.

The dashboard has the following sections:

### Overview

Provides quick access buttons to essential base features:
* **Create Table** - Start building a table from scratch.
* **Import Data** - Upload CSV, Excel, or other supported formats.
* **Connect External Data** - Link to external databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL
* **Create Empty Script** – Write custom JavaScript to automate workflows.
* **Scripts by NocoDB** – Access a library of prebuilt scripts.
* **Create Empty Dashboard** (*coming soon*)– Build custom dashboards with charts and widgets to visualize data.


### Members
Manage who has access to the base. You can invite members, assign them roles, and view existing collaborators.
* Workspace members automatically inherit base access.
* Base owners can adjust these permissions as needed.
See [Base Collaboration](/docs/product-docs/bases/base-collaboration) for more details.

### Permissions
Control fine-grained access to tables and fields. See [Table Permissions](/docs/product-docs/roles-and-permissions/table-permissions) and [Field Permissions](/docs/product-docs/roles-and-permissions/field-permissions) for more details.

### Data Sources
Displays all external connections linked to the base. You can view, add, or remove connections to external databases from here. These external sources are treated like native tables and enhance the base's flexibility. See [Data Sources](/docs/product-docs/data-sources) for more details.

### Settings
Some general base configurations are available for you to modify. See [Base Settings](/docs/product-docs/bases/actions-on-base#base-settings) for more details.
