Snapshots are a powerful feature that allows users to create a point-in-time backup of their base. Whether you’re preparing for major changes or safeguarding against accidental data loss, this feature ensures your data is secure and retrievable.

<Callout type="info">Snapshots are currently available exclusively on cloud-hosted paid plans & self-hosted enterprise plans</Callout>

## Key Notes

- Snapshots do not include audit log data (global audits & records revision history).
- Restoring a snapshot does not modify the current base. Instead, it creates a new base within the same workspace.
- Base-specific user permissions are not restored. Restored bases inherit default workspace permissions. Any custom base-level permissions must be re-applied manually.
- Shared base or shared view settings from the source base are not restored. These need to be reconfigured in the restored base.
- The number of snapshots allowed per base depends on your plan.
- A minimum gap of three hours is required between creating two snapshots. You can delete all existing snapshots and immediately create a new one if needed.
- Only Base Owners can access the snapshot feature.
