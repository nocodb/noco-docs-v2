In NocoDB, a member added to a workspace inherits their role-based permissions across all bases within that workspace. If you need to override a member’s permissions for a specific base, follow the steps below:


## Update members role in your base

1. Access `Base Dashboard` from the left sidebar
2. Navigate to the `Members` tab.
3. Locate the user whose access you want to change.
4. Use the dropdown to assign a new role specific to this base.

<Callout type="info"> Any existing user can invite members to the base, but they can only assign roles that are equal to or lower than their own role. Only the base owner / creator can change the role of a base member.</Callout>

More details about roles & permissions can be found [here](/docs/product-docs/roles-and-permissions).

## Remove members from your base
1. Access `Base Dashboard` from the left sidebar
2. Navigate to the `Members` tab.
3. Locate the user to remove.
4. Set their role to No Access using the dropdown.

<Callout type="info">Removing a member from a base does not delete their account. They can still access other bases in the workspace, unless removed from the workspace entirely.</Callout>

## Direct base invite

In addition to inviting workspace members to a base, you can invite users directly to a specific base (with restricted workspace access). This is useful when you want to grant someone access to only a single base without exposing the rest of the workspace.

When a user is invited directly to a base:

* They are automatically added to the parent workspace with the **No Access** role.
* Their access is restricted exclusively to the base they were invited into.
* They will not be able to view or access any other bases, tables, or data within the same workspace.
* Their name will still appear in the workspace’s member list, but their visibility and access will be limited.

This approach is ideal for sharing specific projects with external collaborators, clients, or temporary contributors without compromising workspace-level visibility.
