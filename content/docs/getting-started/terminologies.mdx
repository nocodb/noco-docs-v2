## Terminologies

| Term                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Base** *(aka Project)* | A **base** is a container for one or more related data sources, each comprising multiple tables. These tables can be linked to represent relationships between datasets. Think of a base as a project workspace for organizing structured data. |
| **Base Owner**           | A **base owner** is the member who initially creates the base. Ownership can be extended to other members by assigning them the owner role within the base. Owners have full administrative privileges over the base.                           |
| **Base Member**          | A **base member** is any user with access to a base, assigned a specific role that defines their permissions such as read-only, editor, creator, or owner.                                                                                      |
| **Cell**                 | A **cell** is the intersection of a row and a column in a table. It holds the actual value of a field in a specific record and represents the most granular unit of data in the grid view.                                                      |
| **Field** *(aka Column)* | A **field** is a named data container within a table that holds values of a specific type (e.g., text, number, date). All records in a table share the same set of fields.                                                                      |
| **Record** *(aka Row)*   | A **record** is a single entry in a table, represented as a row. It contains values across multiple fields and is used to store individual data instances.                                                                                      |
| **Table** *(aka Model)*  | A **table** organizes data into rows (records) and columns (fields). Each table can represent a distinct entity and can be linked to other tables through relationships.                                                                        |
| **View**                 | A **view** defines how records in a table are displayed and interacted with. NocoDB supports multiple view types including **Grid**, **Form**, **Gallery**, **Calendar**, and **Kanban** views.                                                 |
| **Modal**                | A **modal** is a UI overlay that captures user attention for a specific task or interaction, such as editing a record or confirming an action. It temporarily blocks access to the rest of the interface until dismissed.                       |
| **Webhook**              | A **webhook** enables real-time communication between NocoDB and external services. It automatically sends data to a specified URL when a configured event occurs, facilitating integrations and automations.                                   |
| **Workspace**            | A **workspace** is a top-level organizational unit that contains one or more bases. It facilitates collaboration by managing user access and permissions across multiple bases and tables.                                                      |
| **Workspace Owner**      | A **workspace owner** is the user who created the workspace. Additional members can be assigned owner privileges to manage users, roles, and other workspace-level settings.                                                                    |
| **Workspace Member**     | A **workspace member** is a user who has access to the workspace with defined permissions. Members can be assigned roles such as viewer, editor, or admin depending on their responsibilities.                                                  |
