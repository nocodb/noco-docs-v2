<Callout type="info">Available on NocoDB Cloud Business plan onwards and Self-Hosted Enterprise Edition.</Callout>

Ticketing Sync enables you to import issues, tickets, comments, users, and team information from external platforms. It follows a predefined schema that standardizes ticketing data across systems, ensuring consistency even when naming conventions or field availability differ between sources.

Current supported sources include:

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Zendesk
* Linear
* Freshdesk
* Bitbucket
* Chatwoot


You may choose to sync **all tables** in the Ticketing schema or **only specific tables**. Syncing all tables provides full context and complete relationships, while syncing selected tables helps reduce sync time and resource usage based on your workflow needs.

---

## Available Tables

Each table is mapped to a well-defined set of fields to maintain a unified structure. NocoSync also includes relational fields that connect these tables as required. Ticket and User tables are essential and always included, while Comment and Team tables are optional.

### **Ticket**

Represents a ticket, issue, case, or task from the source platform.
**Key fields include:**

* **Description** – Summary or full content of the ticket.
* **Ticket Number** – Unique identifier from the source system.
* **Due Date** – Target completion date.
* **Priority** – Indicates urgency such as Low, Medium, High, or platform-specific values.
* **Status** – Current stage (Open, In Progress, Closed, etc.).
* **Tags** – Labels or metadata applied to the ticket.
* **Ticket Type** – Category such as Bug, Feature, Task, Case, etc.
* **URL** – Direct link to the ticket in the source app.
* **Is Active?** – Indicates whether the ticket is currently active.
* **Completed At** – Timestamp when the ticket was closed or resolved.

This table includes links to **Users**, **Teams**, and **Comments**, depending on the structure available in the connected source.


### **User**

Represents individuals associated with the ticketing system—such as creators, reporters, agents, assignees, or contributors.
**Key fields include:**

* **Email** – Email associated with the user.
* **URL** – Profile link to the user in the external system.

Users are linked to **Tickets** and **Comments** where applicable.


### **Comment**

Stores discussion entries, updates, or notes related to Tickets.
**Key fields include:**

* **Body** – Full comment text.
* **URL** – Link to the comment in the source system.

Comments are relationally connected to both **Tickets** and **Users**.


### **Team**

Represents groups, departments, or squads defined in the external platform.
**Key fields include:**

* **Description** – Summary or name of the team.
* **Members** – Users associated with the team.

Teams may be associated with **Tickets** or **Users**, depending on source capabilities.

## Metadata Fields

Each synced table in the Ticketing category includes a set of metadata fields that track the lifecycle, state, and origin of every record. These fields provide transparency into how data flows from the external source into NocoDB and play an essential role in traceability, debugging, and audit requirements.

These metadata fields are automatically managed by NocoSync and are read-only.


* **RemoteID**
Unique identifier of the record in the external source system.

* **RemoteCreatedAt**
Timestamp of when the record was originally created in the source.

* **RemoteUpdatedAt**
Timestamp of the most recent update made in the source.

* **RemoteDeleted**
Indicates whether the record has been deleted in the source platform.
This is used especially when the delete behaviour is set to **Ignore**.

* **RemoteDeletedTime**
Timestamp of when the record was deleted in the source, if applicable.

* **RemoteRaw**
Stores the raw payload received from the provider for that record.
Useful for troubleshooting, verification, or advanced integrations.

* **RemoteNamespace**
Identifies the origin project, workspace, or repository depending on the provider.
This is valuable for multi-project setups in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Zendesk groups, etc.

* **RemoteSynchedAt**
Last timestamp when NocoDB synced this specific record.

* **SyncConfigID**
Internal reference to the sync configuration used for this record.

* **SyncRunID**
Identifies the specific sync execution run that last updated this record.

* **SyncProvider**
Indicates which external service (GitHub, GitLab, Zendesk, etc.) the record originated from.

## Source Specific Details

Each supported ticketing platform has unique characteristics and field mappings. Below are some source-specific details to consider when configuring your Ticketing sync.

### GitHub

GitHub integration lets you bring issues, pull requests, and related project activity directly into your NocoDB workspace. Connect your GitHub account, pick the repositories you want to track, and NocoSync keeps your tables updated with the latest data.

After selecting GitHub as the sync source, you can:

* **Connect using an existing GitHub integration**
Authenticate once and reuse the connection across multiple syncs. Both OAuth and Personal Access Token methods are supported.

* **Choose one or more repositories**
Pull data from any repo you manage or collaborate on. You can select multiple repositories to consolidate issues and PRs in a single NocoDB base.

* **Include closed issues (optional)**
Sync both open and closed issues to maintain a complete project history. Closed issues are marked accordingly in the Ticket table.

* **Sync pull requests (optional)**
Bring in PRs alongside issues to track code reviews, merges, and engineering workflows. PRs are represented as tickets with a distinct type.

### GitLab

GitLab integration lets you sync project activity—issues, merge requests, comments, and more—directly into your NocoDB workspace.

After selecting GitLab as your sync source, you can:

* **Connect using an existing GitLab integration**
Authenticate once and reuse the connection across multiple projects and syncs. Alternatively, you can set up a new connection using OAuth or Personal Access Token methods.

* **Provide a GitLab Project ID**
Point the sync to any GitLab project you manage or contribute to. NocoDB validates and fetches data from that project automatically.

* **Specify a team key**
Provide the Linear team identifier (e.g., *ENG*) to pull issues from a specific team. This helps maintain clear separation of data when working across multiple teams or departments. To find your team key, go to Linear → Settings → Teams → select your team → copy the Team Identifier (e.g., ENG).

* **Configure issue inclusion options**

  * **Include canceled issues**
Sync canceled issues to maintain a complete historical timeline of project changes and prioritization decisions.
  * **Include completed issues**
Sync completed issues for richer analytics on delivery timelines, resolutions, and sprint outcomes.

Linear as a source helps centralize product and engineering operations—allowing teams to correlate progress with other tools, audit issue lifecycle data, and build custom dashboards that reflect true project execution.
