HRIS Sync enables you to import employees data from external platforms. It follows a predefined schema that standardizes HRIS data across systems, ensuring consistency even when naming conventions or field availability differ between sources.

Current supported sources include:

* BambooHR

You may choose to sync **all tables** in the HRIS schema or **only specific tables**. Syncing all tables provides full context and complete relationships, while syncing selected tables helps reduce sync time and resource usage based on your workflow needs.
