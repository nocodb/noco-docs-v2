Table permissions in NocoDB allow you to control who can create or delete records in each table. This feature helps maintain data integrity while supporting flexible and collaborative workflows.

<Callout type="info">Available on NocoDB Cloud from the **Team** plan onwards, and in **Self-hosted Enterprise** editions.</Callout>

## Enabling Table Permissions

To configure permissions for a specific table:

1. Click the `⋯` icon next to the table name in the sidebar.
2. Select **Edit table permissions**.
3. Use the dropdown menus to define who can:
    * Create records
    * Delete records

## Permission Levels

You can assign different access levels for each action (create or delete record). The available options are:

| Option                      | Who gets access                                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Editors & up**            | Members with **Editor**, **Creator**, or **Owner** roles *(default)* |
| **Creators & up**           | Members with **Creator** or **Owner** roles                          |
| **Specific users or teams** | Selected members or teams                                            |
| **Nobody**                  | No one can perform this action                                       |

By default, members with the **Editor** role and above can create and delete records in a table.

* Choose **Creators & up** to restrict these actions to creators and owners.
* Choose **Nobody** to disable record creation or deletion entirely.
* Choose **Specific users or teams** to grant access only to selected members or teams.

<Callout type="info">Only members and teams with **Editor**, **Creator**, or **Owner** roles can be selected for specific access configuration.</Callout>

### Additional Notes on Table Permissions

* Table permissions **do not control record visibility** — users with access can still view all records. However, their ability to create or delete records depends on the configured permissions.
* Permissions are applied at the **table level** and affect all records within that table. They cannot be defined for individual records or specific subsets.
* Table permissions function **independently** of field permissions; each can be configured separately.
* Table permissions also apply to:
    * Record creation or deletion via **APIs**, and
    * Record creation through **shared forms**.

## Permissions Overview

The permissions overview provides a consolidated summary of table and field permissions across the base.

To access the permissions overview:

1. Go to the base homepage (click **Overview** in the sidebar).
2. Click the **Permissions** tab.

Select the table you want to review. The overview displays both table and field permissions, showing which members or teams can create or delete records and which fields are editable by whom.

You can also open the **Permissions overview** directly from the table or field permission configuration modal.
