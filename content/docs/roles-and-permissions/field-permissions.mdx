<Callout type="info">Available on NocoDB Cloud from the **Team** plan onwards, and in **Self-hosted Enterprise** editions.</Callout>

Field permissions in NocoDB allow you to control who can edit values in specific fields in a table. This feature is particularly useful for managing sensitive data or ensuring that only authorized users can modify certain information.

## Enabling Field Permissions
To configure field permissions for a specific table:

1. Access field context menu from the field header.
2. Select **Edit field permissions**.
3. Use the dropdowns to control who can edit the field.

## Permission Levels
You can assign different levels of access to each field. The available options are:

| Option             | Who gets access                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Editors & up**   | Members with **Editor**, **Creator**, or **Owner** roles *(default)* |
| **Creators & up**  | Members with **Creator** or **Owner** roles                          |
| **Specific users** | Selected members or teams                                            |
| **Nobody**         | No one can edit this field                                           |

By default, users with **Editor** role and above can edit data in all fields in a table.
* Select **Creators & up** to prevent editors from editing values in this field.
* Select **Nobody** to disable editing values for all users in this field.
* Choose **Specific users** to allow only selected members or teams to edit this field.

<Callout type="info">Only members and teams with **Editor**, **Creator**, or **Owner** roles can be selected for specific access configuration.</Callout>

### **Additional Notes on Field Permissions**

* Field permissions **do not control field visibility** — users with access can still view all field data, but their ability to edit values in specific fields depends on the configured permissions.
* Permissions are applied at the **field level**, affecting all records in the table for that specific field. They cannot be configured for individual or selected records.
* Field permissions operate **independently** of table permissions. You can configure field permissions without enabling table permissions, and vice versa.
* Field permissions also apply to **API calls** and **shared forms**, restricting the ability to modify field values through these interfaces.
* Field permissions can be set for all field types except the following, as these are **calculated or system fields** and cannot be edited directly:
    * *Formula*, *Rollup*, *Lookup*, *Created By*, *Last Updated By*, *Created At*, *Last Updated At*, *Button*, *QR Code*, *Barcode*
* For **Link to Another Record (LTAR)** fields, only the source table’s LTAR field permission determines editability (add/remove links). The related table’s LTAR permissions are not considered.
    * *Example:* If **Country** has many **Cities**, and a user has permission to edit the LTAR field in the **Country** table, they can add or remove links to **City** records from the **Country** table — even if they lack edit permission for the **City** table’s corresponding LTAR field.


## Permissions Overview

Permissions overview provides a quick summary of the current table & field permissions in a consolidated tabular view.

To access the permissions overview:
1. Go to base homepage (Click `Overview` in the sidebar).
2. Click the **Permissions** tab.

Subsequently, you can select the table for which you want to view the permissions overview. The overview will display field permissions in addition to table permissions, allowing you to see who can create or delete records in each table, as well as which fields are editable and by whom.

`Permissions overview` can also be accessed from the table / field permission configuration modal.
