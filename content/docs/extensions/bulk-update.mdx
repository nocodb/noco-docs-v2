## Overview

![Bulk Update](/img/v2/extensions/bulk-update/overview.png)

The Bulk Update extension empowers users to modify multiple records across a selected table view simultaneously. Instead of editing each row one by one, you can define field-level updates and apply them to all visible records with a single actionâ€”saving time and reducing manual errors.

## Updating Records
Follow these steps to update multiple records in a table:
1. Select the table and associated view you wish to update.
2. Click the **New Action** button.
3. Choose the **Field** you want to update.
4. Select an **Update Type**:
   - **Set Value**: Set a specific value for the field.
   - **Clear Value**: Clear the field value.
5. If you selected **Set Value**, provide the **Value** to be applied.
6. Click the **Update Records** button to apply the changes.
7. A confirmation dialog will display the number of fields and records to be updated. Review the details and click **Confirm Update** to proceed.

You can add multiple actions to update different fields in the table. 

Bulk updates affect all records within the current view, including those not visible on the screen. Since views are just filtered representations of the same underlying data, any record that appears in multiple views will also reflect the update. These updates apply only to records in the selected view and do not impact records outside of it or in unrelated views.

## Managing Actions
The Update work items added are listed in the **Actions** section. You can:
- **Edit** an action by clicking on the action item in the list & making the necessary changes.
- **Delete** an action by clicking on the delete icon next to the action item.
- **Disable** an action by toggling the switch next to the action item. Disabling an action will prevent it from being applied to the records.

For any configured bulk update extension, you can reuse the **Update Records** button to repeat the batch update process. This is particularly useful when you need to apply the same changes across multiple records in the future.
