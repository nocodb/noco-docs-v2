Extensions are modular components designed to expand and customize your experience with NocoDB. Functioning like plugins, extensions introduce new features and functionalities beyond the platform's core capabilities, allowing users to adapt NocoDB to suit unique requirements and workflows.

This section provides an overview of the Extensions framework, detailing how to install, manage, and utilize extensions to optimize your NocoDB base.
