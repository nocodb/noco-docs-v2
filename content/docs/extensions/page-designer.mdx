## Overview

![Page Designer](/img/v2/extensions/page-designer/overview.png)

The **Page Designer** extension allows users to create printable and shareable (PDF) visual layouts from their database records. Common use cases include generating invoices, reports, certificates, and summaries‚Äîby combining text, images, and dynamic field data in a freeform design canvas.

This feature is ideal for teams who want to convert structured table data into branded, formatted documents directly within NocoDB.

* **Record-specific Rendering**: Auto-populates fields dynamically from the selected record.
* **Supports Linked Records**: Render data from related tables in a tabular, list, or inline format.
* **Full Design Control**: Modify font, alignment, borders, colors, and more for each element.
* **Print & PDF Export**: Preview your design and export directly to PDF.

For linked records displayed in tabluar format, you can choose which fields to display and customize their visibility.
