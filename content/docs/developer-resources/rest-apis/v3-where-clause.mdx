The v3 `where` clause in NocoDB REST API calls is an improvements over v2 where clause. This document provides detailed information on its usage.

## Comparison Operators

No difference with v2 version. See [Comparison Operators](/docs/developer-resources/rest-apis#comparison-operators) on rest api documentation page.

## Comparison Sub-Operators

No difference with v2 version. See [Comparison Sub-Operators](/docs/developer-resources/rest-apis#comparison-sub-operators) on rest api documentation page.

## Logical Operators

No difference with v2 version. See [Logical Operators](/docs/developer-resources/rest-apis#logical-operators) on rest api documentation page.

## Wrapping with Quotes

The v3 `where` clause allows values to be wrapped with quotes (double quotes, single quotes, or backticks) to safely use special characters that might otherwise break older version `where` clauses. This is particularly useful for strings containing commas, parentheses, or other delimiters.

**Example:** Searching for a phrase with special characters:
`("My Field", "like", "Let's come home, and go straight to bed")`

**Another Example:** Searching for a value that includes a comma:
`("Product Name", "=", "Laptop, 15-inch")`

**Example:** Using single quotes for a value:
`('City', '=', 'New York')`

## Usage on v2 API

The v3 `where` clause can also be utilized when using the v2 API by prepending the `where` clause with an `@` sign. This allows you to leverage the advanced capabilities of the v3 `where` clause even in v2 API calls.

**Example:** Using a v3 `where` clause to check for non-blank titles in a v2 API call:
`@("Title", "not", "blank")`

**Another Example:** Combining multiple conditions with special characters in a v2 API call:
`@("and", ("Category", "=", "Electronics"), ("Description", "like", "High-performance, water-resistant"))`
