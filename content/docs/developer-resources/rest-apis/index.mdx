description: 'NocoDB REST API Overview'
---

Once you've created the schemas, you can manipulate the data or invoke actions using the REST APIs. We provide several types of APIs for different usages. Refer to the following links for more details:

- [Meta APIs](https://meta-apis-v2.nocodb.com/)

- [Data APIs](https://data-apis-v2.nocodb.com/)

You will need an API key and endpoint to use the API. The endpoint URL for hosted instances of NocoDB is in the format `https://app.nocodb.com/api/v2/tables/TABLEID/records` and `https://app.nocodb.com/api/v2/meta/bases/BASEID/info`.

- You can find a TABLEID by going to any table in NocoDB > Details > API Snippets.
- You can find your BASEID by clicking the menu icon next to any database, rest APIs > and seeing the BASEID in the url.

Additional information on the REST APIs is provided below.

- When querying using v3 apis, see [v3 Where Clause](/docs/product-docs/developer-resources/rest-apis#v3-where-query-parameter) for a slight difference between the two version's where clause.


## Finding Your API IDs

Before making API calls, you'll need to identify and copy the relevant IDs required for constructing your endpoints. This section walks you through locating each essential identifier.

### Workspace ID

**Workspace ID** is an alphanumeric identifier prefixed with `w` (representing *workspace*) that uniquely identifies your workspace in NocoDB. It appears in the URL bar when viewing any base within the workspace.

You can also find it in the workspace context menu (accessible by clicking the workspace icon in the minibar). Click the ID to copy it to your clipboard.

Workspace ID can also be retrieved from Workspace settings page.

### Base ID

**Base ID** is required for metadata APIs and administrative operations. It uniquely identifies a specific database (or base) within your workspace.

The Base ID is an alphanumeric identifier prefixed with `p` (representing *project*), visible in the URL when accessing any table or base-level settings. You can also find it in the base context menu (chevron next to the base name) in the left sidebar, where you can click the ID to copy it to your clipboard.

![Base ID](/img/v2/developer/base-id.png)

### Table ID

**Table ID** is the most commonly used identifier and is required for all data API calls. It uniquely identifies a specific table within your base.

The Table ID is an alphanumeric string prefixed with `m` (representing *model*), visible in the URL immediately after the Base ID when viewing a table. You can also find it in the table context menu (three dots next to the table name) in the left sidebar. Click the ID to copy it to your clipboard.

### View ID
**View ID** is used for view-specific API operations, such as fetching records from a particular view. It uniquely identifies a specific view within a table.

The View ID is an alphanumeric string prefixed with `v` (representing *view*), visible in the URL when a specific view is open. You can also find it in the view context menu (three dots next to the view name) in the left sidebar. Click the ID to copy it to your clipboard.

![View ID](/img/v2/developer/view-id-1.png)

View ID can also be retrieved from view toolbar > more actions (3 dots) menu

### Field ID
**Field ID** is used for field-specific API operations, such as updating field properties. It uniquely identifies a specific column within a table.

The Field ID is an alphanumeric string prefixed with `c` (representing *column*), visible in the URL when viewing or editing a field’s settings. You can also find it in the field context menu (chevron next to the field name) in the field header bar. Click the ID to copy it to your clipboard.

![Field ID](/img/v2/developer/field-id-1.png)

Field ID can also be retrieved from `Details` > `Fields` editor

### Record ID
**Record ID** is used for record-specific API operations, such as retrieving or updating an individual record. It uniquely identifies a specific row within a table.

By default, the Record ID is a numeric value starting from 1. You can display the **ID** field (which corresponds to the Record ID) by opening the **Fields** menu in the toolbar and enabling **Show System Fields**.

![Record ID](/img/v2/developer/record-id-1.png)

You can also find it in the URL when viewing a specific record (expanded record view).

![Record ID](/img/v2/developer/record-id-2.png)

You can also access the Record ID in formulas by selecting **ID** from the list of available fields in the formula editor or by using the `RECORD_ID()` function.

### User ID
**User ID** is used for user-specific API operations, such as retrieving user details. It uniquely identifies a specific user within your workspace or organization.

The User ID is an alphanumeric string prefixed with `u` (representing *user*). You can find it on either the **Workspace Members** page or the **Base Members** page by clicking the three dots menu next to a user’s name. Click the ID to copy it to your clipboard.

### Data Source ID
For external data sources connected to NocoDB (such as Postgres or MySQL), the **Data Source ID** is additionally required to perform data API operations.

The Data Source ID is an alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies the connected data source. You can find it in the context menu by clicking the three dots next to the data source name in the left sidebar. Click the ID to copy it to your clipboard.

![Data Source ID](/img/v2/developer/datasource-id-1.png)

You can also find it in the Data Source settings page.

## Rate Limits
NocoDB APIs are rate-limited to ensure fair usage and optimal performance for all users. The default rate limit is set to **5 requests per second per user**. These limits are the same across all plans.

If these limits are exceeded, the API will return a 429 status code (Too Many Requests). You’ll need to wait 30 seconds before sending additional requests.

NocoDB may adjust these limits or introduce additional rate tiers based on pricing plans to maintain optimal service performance.

## Comparison Sub-Operators

The following sub-operators are available in the `Date` and `DateTime` columns.

| Operation       | Meaning                 | Example                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| today           | today                   | (colName,eq,today)                |
| tomorrow        | tomorrow                | (colName,eq,tomorrow)             |
| yesterday       | yesterday               | (colName,eq,yesterday)            |
| oneWeekAgo      | one week ago            | (colName,eq,oneWeekAgo)           |
| oneWeekFromNow  | one week from now       | (colName,eq,oneWeekFromNow)       |
| oneMonthAgo     | one month ago           | (colName,eq,oneMonthAgo)          |
| oneMonthFromNow | one month from now      | (colName,eq,oneMonthFromNow)      |
| daysAgo         | number of days ago      | (colName,eq,daysAgo,10)           |
| daysFromNow     | number of days from now | (colName,eq,daysFromNow,10)       |
| exactDate       | exact date              | (colName,eq,exactDate,2022-02-02) |

For `isWithin` in `Date` and `DateTime` columns, the different set of sub-operators are used.

| Operation        | Meaning                 | Example                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| pastWeek         | the past week           | (colName,isWithin,pastWeek)             |
| pastMonth        | the past month          | (colName,isWithin,pastMonth)            |
| pastYear         | the past year           | (colName,isWithin,pastYear)             |
| nextWeek         | the next week           | (colName,isWithin,nextWeek)             |
| nextMonth        | the next month          | (colName,isWithin,nextMonth)            |
| nextYear         | the next year           | (colName,isWithin,nextYear)             |
| nextNumberOfDays | the next number of days | (colName,isWithin,nextNumberOfDays,10)  |
| pastNumberOfDays | the past number of days | (colName,isWithin,pastNumberOfDays,10)  |

## Logical Operators

| Operation | Example                                                            |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~or       | (checkNumber,eq,JM555205)~or((amount,gt,200)~and(amount,lt,2000))  |
| ~and      | (checkNumber,eq,JM555205)~and((amount,gt,200)~and(amount,lt,2000)) |
| ~not      | ~not(checkNumber,eq,JM555205)                                      |

## v3 Where Query Parameter

When calling v3 data api, the where clause has a slight difference with the previous versions. It allows values to be wrapped with quotes (double quotes, single quotes, or backticks) to safely use special characters that might otherwise break older version `where` clauses. This is particularly useful for strings containing commas, parentheses, or other delimiters.

**Example:** Searching for a phrase with special characters:
`("My Field", like, "Let's come home, and go straight to bed")`

**Another Example:** Searching for a value that includes a comma:
`("Product Name", eq, "Laptop, 15-inch")`

**Example:** Using single quotes for a value:
`(City, eq, 'New York')`

### Usage on v2 API

The v3 `where` clause can also be utilized when using the v2 API by prepending the `where` clause with an `@` sign. This allows you to leverage the advanced capabilities of the v3 `where` clause even in v2 API calls.

**Example:** Using a v3 `where` clause to check for non-blank titles in a v2 API call:
`@("Title", not, blank)`

**Another Example:** Combining multiple conditions with special characters in a v2 API call:
`@("Description", like, "High-performance, water-resistant")`
