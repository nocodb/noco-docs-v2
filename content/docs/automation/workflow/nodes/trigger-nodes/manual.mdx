### Manual trigger

The **Manual Trigger** starts a workflow only when a user explicitly runs it.

This trigger does not rely on data changes or schedules and is commonly used for testing or one-time operations.

---

### Configuration

- **Trigger type**: Manual
- **Input source**: User-initiated
- **Table selection**: Optional (depends on actions used)

No additional configuration is required.

---

### How it works

- Workflow does not run automatically
- User clicks **Run** to start execution
- Workflow runs once per manual invocation

---

### Use cases

- Testing workflow logic
- One-off data updates
- Administrative or maintenance tasks
