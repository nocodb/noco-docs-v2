### Scheduled trigger

The **Scheduled Trigger** runs a workflow automatically at defined intervals.

---

### Configuration

- **Frequency**: Hourly, Daily, Weekly, or Custom
- **Time**: Execution time based on workspace timezone
- **Repeat interval**: Optional (for recurring schedules)

---

### How it works

- Workflow runs at scheduled time
- Runs independently of record changes
- Executes even if no data has changed

---

### Use cases

- Daily or weekly reports
- Periodic cleanup tasks
- Scheduled reminders or checks
