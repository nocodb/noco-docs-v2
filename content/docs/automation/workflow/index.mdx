Automation workflows in NocoDB enable you to automate repetitive tasks and streamline your processes. By setting up workflows, you can trigger actions based on specific events or conditions within your base. Each automation starts with a trigger and executes one or more actions, optionally controlled by flow logic such as conditions or iteration.

<Callout type="note">Automation Workflows are currently in beta release & are available on NocoDB Cloud and on-premise licensed deployments.</Callout>


## Automation Structure

An automation consists of the following building blocks:

1. **Trigger node** – Defines *when* the automation runs
2. **Action nodes** – Define *what* happens when the automation runs
3. **Flow nodes** – Control execution logic within the automation


## Trigger Node

A **Trigger** determines when an automation starts. Each automation must have exactly one trigger.


### When manually triggered

Runs the automation only when triggered manually by a user.
Useful for testing workflows or running one-off operations.


### At scheduled time

Runs the automation on a fixed schedule.

**Use cases**

* Daily or weekly reports
* Periodic data cleanup
* Scheduled reminders


### When record created

Triggers when a new record is added to a selected table.

**Use cases**

* Send notifications for new entries
* Auto-create related records
* Initialize default values


### When record updated

Triggers when an existing record is modified.

**Use cases**

* React to status changes
* Sync updates across tables
* Notify stakeholders on field changes


### When record deleted

Triggers when a record is removed from a table.

**Use cases**

* Cleanup dependent records
* Log deletions
* Notify administrators


### When form submitted

Triggers when a form connected to a table is submitted.

**Use cases**

* Lead capture workflows
* Support request handling
* Form-based automation without table access


### When record enters a view

Triggers when a record appears in a specific view for the first time.

> The view’s filters define the trigger condition.

**Use cases**

* Workflow stages
* Approval pipelines
* Task readiness detection


### When record matches conditions

Triggers when a record meets defined conditions.

**Use cases**

* Rule-based automations
* SLA breaches
* Conditional alerts


## Action Nodes

Actions define what the automation does after the trigger fires.
Multiple actions can be chained together.


### Record Actions

#### Create record

Creates a new record in a specified table.

**Common uses**

* Create follow-up tasks
* Insert audit logs
* Sync data across tables


#### Update record

Updates one or more fields in an existing record.

**Common uses**

* Change status fields
* Set computed values
* Mark records as processed


#### Find record

Finds a single record matching specified criteria.

**Common uses**

* Locate related records
* Fetch data for later actions


#### List records

Retrieves multiple records that match defined filters.

**Common uses**

* Batch operations
* Iteration using flow nodes


#### Delete record

Deletes a record from a table.

**Common uses**

* Data cleanup
* Lifecycle enforcement


### Communication Actions

#### Send an email

Sends an email using configured email settings.

**Common uses**

* Notifications
* Alerts
* User confirmations


#### Send message

Sends a message to an external messaging service (for example, Slack).

**Common uses**

* Team notifications
* Operational alerts
* Workflow updates


## Flow Nodes

Flow nodes control how actions are executed within an automation.


### If / else

Adds conditional branching to the workflow.

**Behavior**

* Evaluates a condition
* Executes actions in the **If** branch when true
* Executes actions in the **Else** branch when false

**Use cases**

* Approval logic
* Conditional notifications
* Business rule enforcement


### Iterate

Repeats a set of actions for each item in a list of records.

**Behavior**

* Accepts output from **List records**
* Executes child actions once per record

**Use cases**

* Bulk updates
* Batch notifications
* Record-by-record processing


## Execution Order

1. Trigger fires
2. Actions execute top-to-bottom
3. Flow nodes control branching or repetition
4. Automation completes once all paths finish execution


## Testing and Publishing

* Automations can be configured and tested before activation
* Manual triggers are useful for validation
* Only published automations respond to real events


## Best Practices

* Use **views and conditions** to limit unnecessary executions
* Test with manual triggers before publishing
* Keep automations focused on a single responsibility
* Use flow nodes to avoid duplicating logic
