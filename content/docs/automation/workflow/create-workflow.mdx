### Configuring workflow

[//]: # (![Configuring workflow]&#40;/img/v2/workflows/create-workflow-2.png&#41;)

1. **Name the workflow**
Provide a clear and descriptive name to identify the workflow easily.

2. **Select Trigger**
Choose how the workflow should be initiated. Supported trigger types include:
- **Record trigger** – Runs when a record is created, updated, or deleted
- **Manual trigger** – Runs when triggered manually by a user
- **Button trigger** – Runs when a button field is clicked
- **Webhook trigger** – Runs when an external webhook is invoked

<Callout type="info">Available trigger types may vary by plan.</Callout>

3. **Configure trigger settings**
Based on the selected trigger, configure:
- Trigger event (After Insert, After Update, After Delete, etc.)
- Optional conditions to restrict when the workflow should run
- Optional field-level filtering for update events

4. **Add Action nodes**
Define what happens when the workflow is triggered. Supported actions include:
- **HTTP Request** – Call an external API
- **Run Script** – Execute a JavaScript script
- **Create / Update Record** – Modify data in a table
- **Send Notification** – Notify users via supported channels

5. **Connect nodes**
Use connectors to define the execution order between trigger, action, and flow-control nodes.

6. **Test workflow**
[Optional] Click **Test Workflow** to validate trigger configuration and node execution using sample data.

7. **Create workflow**
Click **Create Workflow** to save the workflow.

### Workflow nodes overview

#### Trigger node
Defines when the workflow starts. Each workflow can have only one trigger node.

#### Action node
Performs an operation when executed. You can add multiple action nodes in a workflow.

#### Flow node
Controls execution logic, such as conditional branching or parallel execution paths.

---

### Workflow with conditions

Workflows can be configured to run only when specific conditions are met.
For example, trigger the workflow only when:
- `Status` changes to `Complete`
- `Priority` equals `High`

A workflow runs only when the condition transitions from **not met** to **met**.

<Callout type="note">Conditions are applicable only for record-based triggers.</Callout>

---

### Enable or disable workflow

Once created, workflows can be toggled on or off:
- **Enabled** – Workflow runs automatically when trigger conditions are met
- **Disabled** – Workflow does not execute, even if triggered

---

### View workflow runs

Monitor workflow executions for debugging and auditing:
1. Open the workflow
2. Navigate to the **Runs** tab
3. Select a run to inspect inputs, node execution status, and outputs
