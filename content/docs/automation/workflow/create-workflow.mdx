### Accessing workflow page

Workflow's in NocoDB are base specific. To create a new workflow, open the desired base and
1. From base **Overview** page, click on the **Create Empty Workflow** button.
   - Alternatively, Click **Create New** in the left sidebar and select **Workflow**.
2. Specify a name for the workflow and click **Create Workflow**.
   - Optionally, provide a description to explain the workflow's purpose.

You will land on the workflow editor page to configure the workflow.
- **Workflow list** : View all workflows in the base in the left sidebar
- **Toolbar** : Access workflow actions and settings
- **Editor** canvas : Design the workflow by adding and connecting nodes
- **Sidebar** : Configure selected node properties

### Configuring workflow

NocoDB Workflow builder provides a visual interface to design automation logic using interconnected nodes. To configure a workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Name the workflow:**
Provide a clear and descriptive name to identify the workflow easily. Optionally, add a description to explain its purpose.

2. **Select Trigger:**
Choose how the workflow should be initiated & configure additional node specific settings (resource & conditions) as required. There can be only one trigger node per workflow. Supported trigger types include:
    - **Record trigger** – Runs when a record is created, updated, or deleted
    - **Manual trigger** – Runs when triggered manually by a user
    - **Scheduled trigger** – Runs at specified time intervals

3. **Add Action nodes:**
Define what happens when the workflow is triggered. You can chain multiple action nodes to perform sequential operations. Common action nodes include:
    - **Create / Update Record** – Modify data in a table
    - **Send Notification** – Notify users via supported channels

4. **Include Flow control nodes:**
[Optional] Add flow control nodes to manage execution logic, such as:
    - **If / else** – Conditional branching based on field values or runtime data
    - **Iterate** – Loop through a list of items and perform actions for each item

5. **Test workflow:**
Use **Test Step** to validate individual nodes to verify correct configuration and expected behavior.

6. **Publish workflow:**
Once satisfied with the configuration, use toggle button in the toolbar to enable the workflow & click **Publish** to save changes. An enabled workflow will run automatically when triggered.
