NocoDB Scripts is a powerful automation engine that allows you to write JavaScript code to interact with your NocoDB bases. Scripts enable you to automate workflows, perform complex operations, transform data, and integrate with external services - all without leaving the NocoDB interface.

### Key Features

- **Database Access**: Query tables and views, create, update, and delete records
- **User Interaction**: Collect input from users with interactive prompts
- **External Integration**: Connect to third-party services via HTTP requests
- **Visual Output**: Display results in formatted tables, markdown, and more
- **TypeScript Support**: Enjoy code completion and type checking in the script editor
