<Callout type="note">
This article refers to the legacy version of webhooks in NocoDB. Refer to [Webhook v3](/docs/product-docs/automation/webhook) for the latest features and improvements.

You can employ webhooks to notify external systems whenever there are additions, updates, or removals of records within NocoDB. This feature allows you to receive instantaneous notifications for any changes made to your database through NocoDB. NocoDB also offers webhooks for bulk endpoints for creating, updating, or deleting multiple records simultaneously.

Note that, Webhooks currently are specific to associated table.
