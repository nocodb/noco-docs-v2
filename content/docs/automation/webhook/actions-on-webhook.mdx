<Callout type="note">
This feature is only available in the paid plans, in both cloud & self-hosted.
</Callout>

Webhook logs in NocoDB provide a detailed record of webhook execution attempts, including request payloads, response status, and error messages (if any). These logs help in monitoring webhook activity, debugging failures, and verifying successful deliveries. Logs can be accessed from the webhook configuration panel for each webhook.
