### Configuring webhook

![Configuring webhook](/img/v2/webhook/create-webhook-v3-1.png)
  
  
1. **Name the webhook** - Give a clear & descriptive name.

2. Select the **Trigger Source** type :  

   - **Record** - Triggers when a record is inserted, updated, or deleted, or for all actions if “Send me everything” is selected.
   - **Manual Trigger / Button Trigger**  - Trigger runs when a user manually clicks a webhook configured button.
   - **Field** (*coming soon*) - Will allow triggers based on changes in specific fields.
   - **View** (*coming soon*) - Will enable triggers based on changes in views or filtered datasets.


3. Select **Trigger Event** type : Refer table [here](#trigger-source-and-event) for available events for each source
4. [Optional] **Trigger based on condition** : details [here](#webhook-with-conditions)
    - Specify the condition for which webhook should be triggered
    - You can select multiple conditions
    - If no condition is selected, webhook will be triggered for all records
    - Conditions are not applicable for Manual Trigger webhook
5. [Optional] **Trigger for updates in specific fields** : details [here](#webhook-on-field-changes-)
   - Select the fields for which webhook should be triggered. This is only applicable for `After Update` event.
   - You can select multiple fields
   - If no field is selected, webhook will be triggered for all fields
6. **Method & URL** : Specify the endpoint that the webhook will call when triggered. You can choose from the following HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and HEAD.
7. [Optional] **Headers & Parameters** : Configure Request headers & parameters
8. [Optional] **Body** : Configure request body. You can use [handlebar syntax](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#simple-expressions) to access and manipulate the data easily. For example, `{{ json event }}` will give you the complete event data (default behaviour if body not configured).
9. [Optional] Click **Test** webhook button to verify if parameter are configured appropriately (with sample payload)
10. Click **Create Webhook** button to create the webhook


### Trigger Source and Event

Webhooks in NocoDB can be configured based on the source of the trigger and the type of event. The table below outlines the available combinations:

| **Trigger Source** | **Trigger Event**  | **Description**                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Record             | Send Me Everything | Triggers on any insert, update, or delete operation |
|                    | After Insert       | Triggers after one or more records are inserted     |
|                    | After Update       | Triggers after one or more records are updated      |
|                    | After Delete       | Triggers after one or more records are deleted      |
| Button Trigger     | —                  | Triggers when a button field is clicked             |

> For more details on using **Button Trigger** webhooks with the **Button** field, see the [Button field documentation](/fields/field-types/custom-types/button).


### Webhook with conditions

Webhooks in NocoDB can be configured to trigger only when specific conditions are met. For example, you may choose to trigger a webhook only when the `Status` field is set to `Complete`. You can define multiple conditions using logical operators like `AND` or `OR`—such as triggering the webhook on record update only when `Status` is `Complete` **and** `Priority` is `High`.

![Webhook with conditions](/img/v2/webhook/create-webhook-conditional.png)

A webhook will only be triggered if the condition transitions from **not met** to **met** during a record event. For instance (for above example), if the original record has `Status = Complete` and `Priority = Low`, and you update it to `Priority = High`, the webhook will trigger—since the condition was not met before but is met after the update. However, if a record already satisfies the condition (`Status = Complete` and `Priority = High`) and you update unrelated fields, the webhook will not be triggered.

**In short**, a webhook is triggered only when the condition changes from **false** (old record) to **true** (new record).

**Note:** Conditions are not applicable for Manual Trigger webhook.

### Webhook on field changes ☁

<Callout type="note">
**Note:** This feature is only available in the paid plans, in both cloud & self-hosted.
</Callout>

For **After Update** event, you can configure webhook to trigger only when **certain fields are updated**. For example, trigger webhook only when `Status` is updated. You can also configure multiple fields.

### Webhook with custom payload ☁

<Callout type="note">
This feature is only available in the paid plans, in both cloud & self-hosted.
</Callout>

In the enterprise edition, you can set up a personalized payload for your webhook. Just head to the `Body` tab to make the necessary configurations. Users can utilize [handlebar syntax](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#simple-expressions), which allows you to access and manipulate the data easily.

Use `{{ json event }}` to access the event data. Sample response is as follows
```json
{
  "type": "records.after.insert",
  "id": "0698517a-d83a-4e72-bf7a-75f46b704ad1",
  "version": "v3",
  "data": {
    "table_id": "m969t01blwprpef",
    "table_name": "Table-2",
    "view_id": "vwib3bvfxdqgymun",
    "view_name": "Table-2",
    "rows": [
      {
        "Id": 1,
        "Tags": "Sample Text",
        "CreatedAt": "2024-04-11T10:40:20.998Z",
        "UpdatedAt": "2024-04-11T10:40:20.998Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


#### Discord Webhook
Discord webhook can be configured to send messages to a Discord channel. Discord request body should contain content, embeds or attachments, otherwise request will fail. Below is an example of Discord webhook payload. More details can be found [here](https://birdie0.github.io/discord-webhooks-guide/discord_webhook.html)

```json
{
  "content": "Hello, this is a webhook message",
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "Webhook",
      "description": "This is a webhook message",
      "color": 16711680
    }
  ]
}
``` 

To send complete event data to Discord, use below payload
```
{
  "content" : {{ json ( json event ) }}
}
```

One can also customize the payload as per the requirement. For example, to send only the `Title` field to Discord, use below payload. Note that, the value of `content` is what that will get displayed in the Discord channel.
```
{
   "content": "{{ event.data.rows.[0].Title }}"
}
```

## Environment Variables
In self-hosted version, you can configure the following environment variables to customize the webhook behavior.
- NC_ALLOW_LOCAL_HOOKS: Allow localhost based links to be triggered. Default: false
