## Tips for Better AI Suggestions

- **Use a descriptive field name**
  Example: Instead of "Type", use "Application Status" or "Task Priority".

- **Set table context**
  The more specific your table name and existing fields are, the better the suggestions.
  _Example_: In a table named “Tasks”, a field called “Priority” will likely suggest: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`.

- **Apply business terms**
  Use industry-appropriate terminology in your field name to guide the AI.
  _Example_: For a field called “Candidate Stage”, suggestions might include: `Applied`, `Screened`, `Interviewed`, `Hired`.
