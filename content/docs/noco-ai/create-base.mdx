## Tips for Better AI Results

- **Be clear and specific**  
  Avoid vague descriptions like “make a project tracker.” Instead, try:  
  > Track multiple projects with assigned team members, tasks, deadlines, and project status updates.

- **Mention key entities and relationships**  
  Include what you want to manage and how they relate.  
  > Each candidate can apply to multiple job openings and be scheduled for multiple interviews.

- **Add extra context**  
  Use fields like **Industry** or **Audience** to help guide the AI.

- **Start simple, refine later**  
  You can edit the prompt and regenerate suggestions if needed.
