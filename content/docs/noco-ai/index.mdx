<Callout type="note">NocoAI is available on cloud deployments of NocoDB. It is currently not supported on self-hosted or on-premise installations.</Callout>

NocoAI brings intelligent automation and AI-powered assistance to the heart of NocoDB. Designed to reduce manual setup and enhance productivity, NocoAI helps you build, extend, and manage your bases using natural language — no technical expertise required.


## Key Features

### Prompt-Based Schema Generation

Build a complete base — including tables, fields, and views — by describing your needs in plain language.

**Example:**
`"Track marketing campaigns with budget, channel, timeline, and performance."`
→ NocoAI auto-generates a fully structured base.

---

### Table Recommendations

Get suggestions for additional tables that align with your existing schema and use case.

**Example:**
Have a `Projects` table? NocoAI may recommend adding related tables like `Clients` or `Invoices`.

---

### Field Recommendations

Receive relevant field suggestions based on the context of the table you're editing.

**Example:**
In a `Tasks` table, suggestions might include:
`Priority`, `Estimated Hours`, `Due Date`.

---

### View Recommendations

Enhance visibility with recommended views tailored to your table’s content.

**Example:**
For a `Leads` table, NocoAI may recommend:

* Kanban View (grouped by Status)
* Calendar View (based on Due Date)
* Filtered Views (e.g., “High Priority”)

---

### Select Options Recommendations

When creating single or multi-select fields, NocoAI suggests logical values based on the field name.

**Example:**
For a field named `Status`, options might include:
`Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Completed`.

---

### Prompt-Based Formula Generation

Generate complex formulas by describing the logic you need.

**Example:**
`"Calculate the number of days between start and end date"`
→ NocoAI outputs:
`DATETIME_DIFF({End Date}, {Start Date}, 'days')`

---

## Use Cases

NocoAI is designed for teams of all sizes and skill levels:

* **Non-technical users** can create databases without needing schema knowledge or coding.
* **Product teams** accelerate prototyping and iteration with AI-assisted schema suggestions.
* **Operations managers** get instant view recommendations to streamline workflows.
* **Data teams** automate calculated fields and reduce setup time.

Whether you're building a CRM, project tracker, or content calendar — NocoAI helps you go from idea to working database in seconds.
