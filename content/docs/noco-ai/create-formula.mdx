## Overview

Writing formulas can be complex and time-consuming. With **NocoAI**, you can now describe the logic you need in plain English, and have a formula generated for you automatically.

This is perfect for non-technical users, power users who want to speed up formula creation, or anyone looking to avoid syntax errors.

## Steps to Generate Formulas Using AI

1. Add a **Formula Field**

    In your table, add field and select **Formula** as the type.

2. Click **Use NocoAI**

    Inside the formula editor, click **✨ Use NocoAI** to open the prompt-based generation interface.

3. **Describe** the Logic in Natural Language

    Write a simple prompt explaining what the formula should do.
    _Example_:
    > Show "✅ Done" if Status is "Completed", else show "⏳ In Progress".

4. **Review** and Insert the Formula

    NocoAI will generate the formula based on your prompt. You can review, modify if needed, and insert it into the formula editor.

5. Click **Save Field**

    Once you're happy with the result, save the field.

</div>

## Tips for Better Formula Suggestions

- **Be precise in your prompt**

    Mention exact field names and values where possible.
    _Example_:
    > Calculate number of days between Start Date and End Date.

- **Use conditional phrases**

    Help the AI understand intent.
    _Example_:
    > If Priority is "High" and Status is not "Completed", show "⚠️ Urgent".

- **Refer to data types clearly**

    Indicate if you’re working with dates, numbers, checkboxes, or text.
    _Example_:
    > Add 7 days to the Created Date.

## Example Prompts and Outcomes

| Prompt                                             | Resulting Formula (Example)                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| If Status is "Done", show "✅", else show "⏳"       | `IF({Status} = "Done", "✅", "⏳")`                 |
| Show the number of days between Start and End Date | `DATETIME_DIFF({End Date}, {Start Date}, "days")` |
| If Due Date is past today, mark as "Overdue"       | `IF({Due Date} < TODAY(), "Overdue", "")`         |
| Combine First Name and Last Name into one field    | `CONCAT({First Name}, " ", {Last Name})`          |
