## Tips for Better AI Suggestions

When using the **Auto Suggested** option, NocoAI analyzes your table's data and structure to provide relevant view suggestions. Here are some tips to get the most out of this feature:

- **Be descriptive**: Clearly state how you want the data grouped or filtered.
  _Example_: “Show candidates grouped by status” or “Create a gallery view of job listings.”

- **Mention layout preferences**: Indicate the desired layout if any — Grid, Kanban, Calendar, etc.

- **Use data cues**: Reference field names or data patterns.
  _Example_: “List interviews scheduled this week” or “Show recently updated resumes.”

## Example Prompts for "Use Prompt" Tab

- "Show candidates grouped by status in a Kanban view."
- "Create a calendar view for upcoming interviews."
- "List job openings that have more than 5 applicants."
- "Gallery of candidate profiles with photos and resumes."
