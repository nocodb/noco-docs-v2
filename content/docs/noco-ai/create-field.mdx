## Steps to Create Fields Using AI

Open any existing table where you want to add fields.

1. Click **+ Add Field**

   In the table header, click the **+ Add Field** button.

2. Use **NocoAI Suggestions**

   In the field creation dialog, select **✨ Use NocoAI** to get AI-powered suggestions.

3. Choose from Suggested Fields

   NocoAI will analyze your table name, existing fields, and related context to recommend relevant fields. You can edit field names, types, and options as needed.

4. Click **Create [X] Fields**

   Select the ones you need and confirm to add them to your table.

## Tips for Better AI Suggestions

- **Name your table clearly**
  For example, use "Job Applications" instead of "Table 1" to help NocoAI make better field recommendations.

- **Think in terms of attributes**
  Consider what information each record should store.
  _Example_: A “Candidate” table may need Full Name, Email, Phone, Resume, Status, and Applied Date.

- **Leverage existing fields**
  NocoAI takes into account your current setup to avoid duplicates and suggest only what's missing.

- **Use it iteratively**
  You can always run field suggestions multiple times as your table evolves.

## Example Scenarios

Here are examples of what NocoAI might suggest based on table name:

| Table Name         | Suggested Fields                                       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Leads`            | Name, Email, Source, Status, Last Contacted            |
| `Tasks`            | Title, Due Date, Priority, Assigned To, Status         |
| `Job Applications` | Candidate Name, Resume, Email, Phone, Application Date |
