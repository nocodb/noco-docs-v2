## Overview

With NocoAI, you can automatically generate tables — including their fields and relationships — just by describing your system in plain language. Ideal for getting started quickly with a new database structure or adding new modules to an existing base.

## Tips for Better AI Suggestions

- **Use meaningful table names in your base**  
  The AI looks at existing names and structures to recommend relevant tables.

- **Think in entities**  
  Imagine the business objects you want to manage (e.g., Candidates, Applications, Feedback, Agencies) and how they connect.

- **Preview and refine**  
  If the suggestions aren't accurate, use the **Suggest More** button to regenerate.

- **Add new modules incrementally**  
  You can trigger NocoAI for different parts of your app — e.g., one time for recruiting, another for feedback — to build your schema progressively.

## What's Next

Once your tables are created:

- Use **[NocoAI View Suggestions](/docs/product-docs/noco-ai/create-view)** to generate meaningful views
- Create **[Fields using AI](/docs/product-docs/noco-ai/create-field)** to automatically generate relevant fields for each table

NocoAI gives you a head start — you can customize everything further to meet your needs.
