The **Number** field is a numerical field used to store integer values. It is commonly used for data such as age, salary, price, or quantity.

## Create a Number field

1. Click the `+` icon next to the last field in your table.
2. Enter a name for the field.
3. Select **Number** from the list of field types.
4. (Optional) Toggle **Show thousands separator** to format large numbers with a thousand separator (e.g., 1,000 instead of 1000).
5. (Optional) Set a default value for the field and add a description.
6. Click **Save field** to add the field to your table.

## Cell display

The **Number** field appears as a numeric cell in the table. Its display aligns to the right by default for clarity and consistency when handling numerical data. If the **Show thousands separator** option is enabled, large numbers will be formatted with a comma as the thousand separator.
