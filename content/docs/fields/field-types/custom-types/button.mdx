The **Button** Field allows users to create interactive buttons within their tables. These buttons can trigger specific actions, making workflows more dynamic and efficient. With the Button Field, you can navigate to external URLs, run custom webhooks, or even run custom scripts with a single click.

NocoDB currently supports following actions for the Button Field:
1. **Open URL**: Opens a new tab with a URL generated by a formula within the button field. The URL can be static or dynamic based on the current record's data.
2. **Run Webhook**: Trigger a webhook with the configured URL & custom payload. Payload can include data from the current record.
3. **Run Script**: Execute a custom script that can perform various operations on the current record or the entire table. Current record information can be accessed using the `row` variable in the script.

<Callout type="note">**Run Script** action is currently available only in the NocoDB Cloud version, Plus and above plans.</Callout>

<Callout type="note">For the **"Run Webhook"** action, a webhook with the required trigger type must first be created in the **Webhooks** section. The same webhook can be reused across multiple Button fields. Please note that the **"Run Webhook"** action is not available in shared views or shared bases.</Callout>

#### Edit Webhook
To edit a webhook, click on the `Edit` icon next to the webhook name in the Button field settings. This will open the webhook settings modal, where you can edit the webhook URL, method, headers, and payload. Click on the `Save changes` button to save the changes.

Created webhook can be accessed by using the [Webhook](/docs/product-docs/automation/webhook) section in details tab. For more details, refer to the following articles:
- [Create webhook](/docs/product-docs/automation/webhook/create-webhook)
- [Edit webhook](/docs/product-docs/automation/webhook/actions-on-webhook#edit-webhook)
- [Delete webhook](/docs/product-docs/automation/webhook/actions-on-webhook#delete-webhook)

<Callout type="note">Deleting a webhook will remove it from all Button fields that reference it, whereas deleting a Button field will not affect the associated webhook. A single webhook can also be reused across multiple Button fields.</Callout>

### Button Script

Also termed as "Row Actions", Button Scripts let you trigger pre-configured actions directly from a record in Grid / Kanban / Gallery views. Instead of manually editing fields to update values like status or stage, you can now perform repetitive updates in a single click.

Each button is configured to execute a Frontend Script that updates the record or performs other automated actions. When a user clicks the button, the configured script runs in the context of that record.

Sample Script to update a field value:
```javascript
const recordID = cursor?.row?.id;
const table = await base.getTable("Table-1");

if(recordID) {
    // Perform operations if recordID is valid
    console.log(`Record ID is: ${recordID}`);

    // You can add more logic here based on your requirements
    await table.updateRecordAsync(recordID, {
        "Status": "Completed",
        "Title": "Default Title"
    })
} else {
    // Handle the case where recordID is undefined or null
    console.error('Record ID is not defined');
}
```
