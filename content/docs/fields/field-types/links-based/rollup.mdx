`Rollup` fields are used to aggregate data from fields in the related table. Often used to calculate totals, averages, and other aggregate data.

## Create a Rollup Field
1. Click the `+` icon next to the last field in your table.
2. Enter a name for the field.
3. Select **Rollup** from the list of field types.
4. Select the **Link Field** from the dropdown. This is the field that links the current table to the related table.
5. Select the **Rollup Field** from the dropdown. This is the field whose values will be aggregated.
6. Select the **Aggregation function** from the dropdown. This is the function that will be used to aggregate the data.
7. Configure any additional options like `Precision` for numerical aggregations.
8. **Only include linked records that meet specific conditions**: (Optional) Enable this option to filter the linked records based on criteria defined from fields in the related table. [Read more](#conditional-rollup)
9. Click on `Save Field` button.

### Aggregation Functions
Here's a table with brief descriptions for each of the aggregation functions supported by NocoDB:

| Aggregation Function | Description                                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Count                | Counts the number of records in a dataset.              |
| Minimum              | Retrieves the minimum value from a dataset.             |
| Maximum              | Retrieves the maximum value from a dataset.             |
| Average              | Calculates the average value in a dataset.              |
| Sum                  | Adds up all the values in a dataset.                    |
| Count Distinct       | Counts the number of distinct values in a dataset.      |
| Sum Distinct         | Adds up all the distinct values in a dataset.           |
| Average Distinct     | Calculates the average of distinct values in a dataset. |



## Conditional Rollup

Rollup fields are used to perform calculations—such as sum, average, count—on linked records from a related table. By default, the rollup includes **all** linked records. However, you can fine-tune the results by including only those records that meet specific criteria.

To do this, enable the option:
**Only include linked records that meet specific conditions**

This option allows you to apply filters to the linked records before the rollup calculation is performed. It’s particularly useful when you want to aggregate values conditionally—like summing revenue for a specific period or counting items that meet a threshold.
