`Lookup` fields help bring additional field information from related table into the current table. This is useful when you want to display additional information about a record in a table. For example, if you have a table of `Orders` and a table of `Customers`, you can use a `Lookup` field to display the customer's name and address in the `Orders` table.

## Create a Lookup Field

1. Click on `+` icon to the right of `Fields header`
2. On the dropdown modal, enter the field name (Optional).
3. Select the field type as `Lookup` from the dropdown.
4. Select the link field from the dropdown. This is the field that links the current table to the related table.
5. Select the field for display from the dropdown. This is the field that will be displayed in the current table.
6. Click on `Save Field` button.

## Conditional Lookup

By default, a Lookup field pulls in **all** linked records from the related table. However, in many cases, you may want to display only a subset of those records — for example, only recent entries or records above a certain threshold.

To achieve this, you can enable the option:
**Only include linked records that meet specific conditions**

This option allows you to filter the linked records based on criteria defined from fields in the related table. It helps tailor the Lookup field to show only the data that’s most relevant to your use case.

### Applying filters

1. Toggle ON **Only include linked records that meet specific conditions**.
2. Click **Add filter** to define one or more conditions using fields from the related table.
3. Use **Add filter group** to combine filters with AND/OR logic.
4. Click **Save Field** to apply.
