`Lookup` fields help bring additional field information from related table into the current table. This is useful when you want to display additional information about a record in a table. For example, if you have a table of `Orders` and a table of `Customers`, you can use a `Lookup` field to display the customer's name and address in the `Orders` table.

1. Click the `+` icon next to the last field in your table.
2. Enter a name for the field.

## Conditional Lookup

By default, a Lookup field pulls in **all** linked records from the related table. However, in many cases, you may want to display only a subset of those records — for example, only recent entries or records above a certain threshold.

To achieve this, you can enable the option:
**Only include linked records that meet specific conditions**

This option allows you to filter the linked records based on criteria defined from fields in the related table. It helps tailor the Lookup field to show only the data that’s most relevant to your use case.
