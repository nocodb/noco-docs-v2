The **Email** field is a text-based field designed specifically for storing email addresses. It is a specialized version of the **Single line text** field with the following enhancements:

- Optional validation to ensure values follow a valid email format
- Display of values as clickable email links

## Create an Email field

1. Click the `+` icon next to the last field in your table.
2. Enter a name for the field.
3. Select **Email** as the field type.
4. (Optional) Enable validation by toggling the **Validate Email** option.
5. (Optional) Set a default value for the field and add a description.
6. Click **Save field** to add it to your table.

Refer to the general guidelines on [creating a field](/docs/product-docs/fields#create-a-field).
