The **Long text** field is a text-based field that supports multiple lines of text. It is ideal for storing extended content such as descriptions, notes, or comments.

## Create a long text field

1. Click the `+` icon next to the last field in your table.
2. Enter a name for the field.
3. Select **Long text** from the list of field types.
4. (Optional) Enable **Rich text** formatting. Learn more [here](/docs/product-docs/fields/field-types/text-based/rich-text).
5. (Optional) Set a default value for the field and add a description.
6. Click **Save field** to add the field to your table.

Refer to the general guidelines on [creating a field](/docs/product-docs/fields#create-a-field).

## Cell display

The **Long text** field appears as a standard text cell in the table. The number of visible lines depends on the row height.
