The **Single line text** field stores short text like names, emails, or phone numbers. It supports plain, single-line input.

3. Choose `Single line text` as the type.

    - This value appears automatically when creating new records.
5. Set field description (optional).
   - This description appears as a tooltip when hovering over the field name.
   - It can be used to provide additional context or instructions for users.
6. Click **Save Field**.

## Cell display
In table view, content appears as a single line. If the text exceeds the cell width, it is truncated with an ellipsis. To show more content, adjust the [Record height](/docs/product-docs/table-operations/row-height) settings.
