The **Single line text** field is used to store short, freeform text values. It is suitable for entries like names, titles, tags, or labels. This is the most commonly used field type for capturing simple text in a structured format. For storing longer text or multiple lines, consider using the [Long text](/docs/product-docs/fields/field-types/text-based/long-text) field instead.

## Create a Single line text field

1. Click on the `+` icon next to the last field in your table.
2. Enter a name for the field.
3. Select `Single line text` from the list of field types.
4. Optionally, you can set a default value for the field & add a description.
5. Click on `Save field` to add the field to your table.

Refer here for generic guidelines on [creating a field](/docs/product-docs/fields#create-a-field).

## Cell display
Cells in a **Single line text** field display the text value entered. If the text exceeds the cell width, it will be truncated with an ellipsis (`...`). To view or edit the full text, simply double-click the cell or press the `Enter` key while the cell is selected. This will allow you to edit the text inline.
