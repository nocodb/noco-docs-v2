The **Single line text** field is used to store short, freeform text values. It is suitable for entries like names, titles, tags, or labels. This is the most commonly used field type for capturing simple text in a structured format. For storing longer text or multiple lines, consider using the [Long text](/docs/product-docs/fields/field-types/text-based/long-text) field instead.
