Refer to the general guidelines on [creating a field](/docs/product-docs/fields#create-a-field).

<Callout type="tip">
- You can use explicit numerical values/ strings as needed, e.g. `123` (numeric) or `"123"` (string).
- You can reference field names in equation with `{}`, e.g. `{field name}`
- Nested formula (formula equation referring to another formula field) is supported
</Callout>


<Callout type="info"> Unlike other field types, formula cells cannot be modified by double-clicking since the value is generated based on the formula.
