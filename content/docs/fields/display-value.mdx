The `Display Value`, as its name suggests, serves as the primary or main value within a record of a table, and it is typically the attribute by which we identify or associate that specific record. While it is advisable for the display value to be linked to a field with unique identifiers, such as a primary key, it's important to note that this uniqueness is not always enforced at the database level.

## Use of Display Value
- Within a spreadsheet, `Display Value` are always highlighted so that it is easier to recognise what record we are working with.
- And when `Links` are created between two tables - it is the Display Value that appears in `Linked records` modal.

## FAQ

**How is Display Value identified for existing database tables?**

    For existing database tables, NocoDB automatically selects the Display Value based on the structure of the table. By default, it chooses the first non-numeric field after the primary key. If no such field exists, the field immediately following the primary key is used instead.

**Can I change the Display Value to another field within tables?**

    Yes. Find details [here](/docs/product-docs/fields/display-value#set-display-value).
