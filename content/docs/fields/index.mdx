Fields define the structure and type of data stored in each record of a table. They are the building blocks of your database, determining how information is entered, displayed, and interpreted. Whether you're capturing names, numbers, dates, selections, or calculated values—fields provide the necessary flexibility to model your data accurately.

This section will guide you through the different types of fields available, their configurations, and best practices for choosing the right field type based on your use case. By understanding how fields work, you can design more effective tables and ensure consistent, meaningful data across your workspace.

Among all fields in a table, two hold special significance: the **[primary key](/docs/product-docs/fields/primary-key)** and the **[display value](/docs/product-docs/fields/display-value)**. The **primary key** is a technical identifier that uniquely distinguishes each record and is essential for backend operations like updates, deletions, and maintaining data integrity. It is always unique and typically hidden from end users. On the other hand, the **display value** is a human-readable label—such as a name or title—used in the interface to help users quickly identify and associate records. While it’s recommended to use a field with unique values as the display value, strict uniqueness is not enforced. In essence, the primary key ensures consistent record management, while the display value improves usability and context.


## Create a Field

To add a new field to your table:

1. Click on the ➕ icon in the table header where you'd like to insert the new field.
2. In the **New Field** panel:
    * Enter the field name (optional at first).
    * Select the appropriate **field type** from the list (e.g., Single line text, Number, Lookup, etc.).
3. Configure additional settings such as default value and description as needed.
4. Click **Save Field** to finalize the creation.

Depending on the field type selected, additional options or configurations may be required—such as allowed values, precision, formulas, or linked table settings. Refer to the documentation for each field type for detailed guidance.

## Field Types

NocoDB offers a wide range of field types to help you structure your data effectively. From basic text and numeric fields to more advanced options like linked records, formulas, and custom types, each field serves a specific purpose. The table below provides an overview of all available field types along with brief descriptions to help you choose the right one for your use case.
