A primary key is a special database table field designated to uniquely identify each table record. As it uniquely identifies an individual record of a table, it is used internally by NocoDB for all operations associated with a record

## Primary Key in NocoDB
Primary Key that gets defined / used in NocoDB depends on how underlying table was created. Summary is captured below

1. From UI, Create new table / Import from Excel / Import from CSV
    1. An `ID` [datatype: Integer] system field created by default during table creation is used as primary key
    2. Additional system fields `created-at`, `updated-at` are inserted by default

2. Connect to existing external database
    1. Existing `primary key` field defined for a table is retained as is; NocoDB doesn't insert a new ID field
    2. Additional system fields `created-at`, `updated-at` are not inserted by default

3. Import from Airtable
    1. Airtable record ID is marked as primary key for imported records, and is mapped to field `ncRecordId`  [datatype: varchar]
    2. If a new record is inserted after migration & if ncRecordId field was omitted during record insertion - auto generated string will be inserted by NocoDB
    3. Computed hash value for the entire record is stored in system field `ncRecordHash`
    4. Additional system fields `created-at`, `updated-at` are not inserted by default

4. Create new table using SDK / API
    1. No default primary key field is introduced by NocoDB. It has to be explicitly specified during table creation (using attribute `pk: true`)

### FAQ

**What if Primary Key was missing?**

    In NocoDB, it's possible for a table to have no primary key—this can happen if the table is created externally or through the SDK/API without specifying one. While new records can still be added to such tables, updating or deleting them won’t be possible since there's no unique identifier to reference each record.


**Can I change the Primary Key to another field within tables?**

    You can't update Primary Key from NocoDB UI. You can reconfigure it at database level directly & trigger `meta sync` explicitly.
