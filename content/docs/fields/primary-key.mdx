A **primary key** is a field that uniquely identifies each record in a table. NocoDB relies on it internally to perform create, update, and delete operations on records.

## How Primary Key Works in NocoDB

Primary key behavior depends on how the table was created:

### 1. UI / Excel / CSV Import

* NocoDB adds a default `ID` field (`Integer`) as the primary key.
* System fields `created-at` and `updated-at` are also added.

### 2. External Database

* Existing primary key is retained.
* No new `ID`, `created-at`, or `updated-at` fields are added.

### 3. Airtable Import

* Airtable’s record ID is mapped to `ncRecordId` (`varchar`) as primary key.
* If `ncRecordId` is missing on insert, NocoDB auto-generates it.
* `ncRecordHash` stores a hash of the entire record.
* No `created-at` or `updated-at` fields are added.

### 4. SDK / API

* You must explicitly define the primary key using `pk: true`.
* No default `ID` is added.

<Callout type="info"> **No Primary Key?** You can create a table without a primary key (e.g., via external DB or API). However, NocoDB won’t support **update** or **delete** operations on such records. </Callout>

<Callout type="info"> **Can I change the Primary Key?** No, the primary key can’t be changed via the UI. You must update it directly in your database and run a **Meta Sync** in NocoDB.</Callout>
