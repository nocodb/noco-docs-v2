## Create API Token

Open Account Settings page from the user menu in the bottom left corner of the sidebar. 
1. Click on `User menu` in the bottom left corner of the sidebar,
2. Select `Account Settings` from the dropdown

Follow the steps below to create API Token
1. Click on `Tokens` tab in the `Account Settings` page
2. Click on `Add New API Token`
3. Enter the name for the API Token
4. Click on `Save` button to save the changes
5. Copy the API Token by clicking on `Copy` button displayed under `Actions` menu
6. Use the API Token in the services that require it to authenticate. You can use either the `xc-token` header or the `Authorization` header with bearer token format.

**Option 1: Using xc-token header**
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "xc-token": "Copied API token here under quotes"
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Using Authorization header (since v0.264.7)**
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer Copied API token here under quotes"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">API Token does not expire, but can be deleted anytime. Both `xc-token` and `Authorization: Bearer` header formats are supported for authentication.</Callout>

API Token created will get added to the list. Copy API token by clicking on `Copy` button displayed under `Actions` menu

## Authentication Methods

NocoDB supports two methods for API token authentication:

### Method 1: xc-token Header
Use the `xc-token` header with your API token value directly:
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "xc-token": "your_api_token_here"
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Authorization Header (since v0.264.7)
Use the standard `Authorization` header with Bearer token format:
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_token_here"
  }
}
```

Both methods are equivalent and provide the same level of security. Choose the one that best fits your application's authentication patterns.

## Delete API Token
<Callout type="warn">
Note that, all the services using the API Token will stop working once the API Token is deleted.
</Callout>

Open Account Settings page from the user menu in the bottom left corner of the sidebar.
1. Click on `User menu` in the bottom left corner of the sidebar,
2. Select `Account Settings` from the dropdown

2. From the `Actions` menu, click on `Delete` button associated with the API Token to be deleted

## API Token Access with SSO-Enabled Workspaces

If a workspace is configured to enforce Single Sign-On (SSO), API access to that workspace is restricted to tokens that are created **after authenticating via SSO**.

<Callout type="warn">**Tokens created before SSO was enabled** do not have the necessary identity context and **will not work** for SSO-enforced workspaces.</Callout>

To access an SSO-enforced workspace via API, users must:

1. Sign in using SSO.
2. Generate a new API token from their authenticated session.

<Callout type="info">Tokens created before SSO enforcement may still work for other workspaces that do not require SSO.</Callout>

For ease of identification, tokens created after SSO is enabled will have a badge indicating they were generated through SSO authentication.

### What Happens When SSO is Disabled?

If SSO is later disabled for a workspace:

* API tokens that were created via SSO authentication will **continue to work** as long as the user is still active and has the required permissions.
* Tokens created prior to enabling SSO will continue to function & can now access the workspace without SSO authentication.
* No tokens are automatically revoked when SSO is disabled.
