NocoDB offers a functionality that allows users to connect with Google OAuth 2.0, enabling them to log into their NocoDB accounts using their Google authentication credentials. This article provides a step-by-step guide to integrating Google OAuth 2.0 with NocoDB.

<Callout type="info">For users on **Business plan**, the SSO configuration menu is available under **Workspace Settings**.
    Refer [here](/docs/product-docs/account-settings/authentication#business-plan) for more details.</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">**Domain Verification Required for Cloud Plans**: Before configuring Google OAuth, you must verify your domain in NocoDB (required for both Business and Enterprise plans in the cloud). Only users with email addresses from verified domains can sign in via SSO. See [Domain Verification](/docs/product-docs/account-settings/authentication#domain-verification-required-for-cloud-plans) for details.</Callout>

1. **Verify your domain** (Cloud Plans only)
    - **Business Plan**: Navigate to **Workspace Settings** > **Authentication** > **Domain Verification**
    - **Enterprise Plan**: Navigate to **Account Settings** > **Authentication** > **Domain Verification**
    - Add your domain and complete the TXT record verification process
    - This step is required before configuring any SSO provider

2. Copy `Redirect URL` from NocoDB
    - **Cloud version**: Go to `Workspace Settings` > `Authentication` > `Google OAuth`
    - **On-prem version**: Go to `Account Settings` > `Authentication` > `Google OAuth`
    - Copy the `Redirect URL` from the `Google OAuth` section
3. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.
4. Visit the `OAuth consent screen` within the `APIs & Services` section.
    a) Decide on the configuration and registration preferences for your application, specifying the intended user demographic
    b) Click on the `Create` button
5. Set up the OAuth consent screen by providing details about the application and specifying the authorized domains where you host NocoDB.
6. Proceed to the `Credentials` screen, then click on `Create Credentials`. Choose `OAuth Client ID` from the available options to generate OAuth credentials.
7. Choose `Web application` from the options available in the `Application type` dropdown menu.
8. Configure the following
    a) `Authorized JavaScript origins` refer to the HTTP origins where your web application is hosted, such as https:///app.nocodb.com
    b) `Authorized Redirect URIs` refer to the URIs where the user is redirected after successful authentication with Google. Paste the *Redirect URL* copied from NocoDB in step (2).
9. Click on the `Create` button to generate the OAuth credentials. Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs section.
10. Go back to NocoDB and paste the credentials in in the respective fields in the `Google OAuth` section:
    - **Cloud version**: `Workspace Settings` > `Authentication` > `Google OAuth`
    - **On-prem version**: `Account Settings` > `Authentication` > `Google OAuth`
