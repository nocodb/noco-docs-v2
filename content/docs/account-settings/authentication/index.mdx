This section provides an overview about different mechanisms available for authentication in NocoDB.

# Email and password based
This is the default form based authentication mechanism available in NocoDB. Users can sign up using email and password and then login using the same credentials.

# Single Sign On (SSO)
<Callout type="info">For SSO Access - please reach [**out to sales team**](https://cal.com/nocodb)</Callout>

SSO is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. 

SSO functionality is achieved by establishing a connection with an identity provider (IdP), which serves as a repository for managing users digital identities within the digital or cloud-based ecosystem. Through the use of protocols like the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0), such as in the case of NocoDB, SSO facilitates the secure exchange of authentication data between the identity provider and the service providers.

<Callout type="warning">Once SSO is enabled for a workspace, API access is restricted to tokens generated after signing in via the configured identity provider (IdP). Tokens created before SSO was enabled will no longer work for that workspace and must be regenerated through an SSO-authenticated session.

### Google OAuth

Google OAuth, short for Open Authorization, is a widely used and standardized protocol that facilitates secure authentication and authorization processes, particularly in the context of web and mobile applications. Developed by Google, OAuth enables users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources without exposing their credentials. This authorization framework is based on token-based authentication, where users can log in using their Google credentials, and developers can obtain an access token to interact with Google APIs on the user's behalf.

Please follow the details in the article to integrate with [Google OAuth](/docs/product-docs/account-settings/authentication/google-oauth)

### Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 
The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) stands as a critical protocol in the realm of secure authentication and authorization processes. Developed to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality, SAML facilitates the exchange of authentication and authorization data between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). This XML-based protocol ensures the secure transfer of user identity information, allowing individuals to access multiple applications and services with a single set of credentials. SAML operates on a trust model, wherein the identity provider asserts the user's identity to the service provider, which, in turn, grants or denies access based on the provided assertions.

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)
The OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol is a modern authentication layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework, designed to address user authentication and authorization challenges in web and mobile applications. OIDC provides a standardized and secure way for applications to verify the identity of end-users. Leveraging JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), OIDC enables the exchange of user identity information between the identity provider (IdP) and the Service provider, typically a web application.

## Accessing the SSO Configuration Menu

The location of the **SSO configuration menu** varies depending on your plan.

* If you're on the **Business plan**, you can access SSO settings from the **Workspace Settings**.
* For **Enterprise plan** users, the SSO menu is available under the **Admin Panel**.

Please follow the steps relevant to your plan to locate and configure SSO.

### Business Plan

To access the SSO configuration menu in the Business plan, navigate to the **Workspace Settings**. Here, you can manage your SSO settings, including adding new identity providers and configuring existing ones.

![SSO Configuration](/img/v2/account-settings/accessing-sso-business-plan.png)

Alternatively, you can directly access the SSO configuration screen using the URL:
`https://app.nocodb.com/#/workspaceID/settings?tab=sso`

#### Domain Verification (Required for Cloud Plans)

For **NocoDB Cloud** users (both Business and Enterprise plans), domain verification is required before configuring SSO providers. This ensures that only users with email addresses from your verified domain can access the workspace through SSO.

**Domain Verification Process:**
1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings** > **Authentication** > **Domain Verification** (Business Plan) or **Account Settings** > **Authentication** > **Domain Verification** (Enterprise Plan)
2. Add your domain (e.g., `example.com`)
3. Copy the provided TXT record from NocoDB
4. Add the TXT record to your domain's DNS settings
5. Wait for DNS propagation (this may take a few minutes to several hours)
6. Verify the domain by clicking the verification button in NocoDB

Once verified, only users with email addresses under your verified domain(s) will be able to sign in via SSO. For example, if you've verified `example.com`, only users with emails like `user@example.com` will be allowed to sign in through the SSO page.

<Callout type="info">**On-premise deployments** do not require domain verification. You can configure SSO providers directly without verifying your domain via DNS.</Callout>

### Enterprise Plan

For users on the Enterprise plan, the SSO configuration menu is located in the **Account Settings**. This allows for more advanced SSO configurations and management options across the entire organization.

1. Click on the user icon in the bottom left corner of the NocoDB interface.
2. Select **Account Settings** from the menu.
3. Navigate to the **Single Sign-on (SSO)** tab.
