The **Bar Chart** widget in NocoDB dashboards allows you to compare values across different categories. It is especially useful for highlighting trends, distributions, or comparisons between groups.

## Title & Description
- **Title**: Enter a title for the bar chart widget. This will be displayed prominently at the top of the widget.
- **Description**: Optionally, add a description to provide context or details about the data being visualized. This will appear below the title.

## Data Source
- **Table**: Select the table from which you want to pull data for the bar chart.
- **Records**: Choose which records to include:
    - **All Records**: Displays all records from the selected table.
    - **Records from a view**: Uses records from a specific view, allowing you to apply existing filters and sorts.
    - **Specific Records**: Apply custom filters to select only certain records.

## Display

### X-axis
- **Field**: Select the field whose values will be shown as categories along the X-axis (e.g., Product, Region, Status).
- **Sort By**: Choose the criteria to sort categories:
    - **xAxis Value**: Sorts based on the label values.
    - **yAxis Value**: Sorts based on the numeric values plotted.
- **Order**: Select Default, Ascending, or Descending order.
- **Include empty records**: Optionally, include categories that do not have values.
- **Include others**: Toggle to combine small or excess categories into an “Others” group for better readability.

### Y-axis
- **Fields**: Choose the field(s) that determine the bar lengths. You can add multiple fields for comparison.
- **Field Summary**: Displays the **Sum, Average, Min, or Max** of a numeric field.
- **Start at zero**: Ensures the Y-axis always begins at zero, which improves accuracy in comparing bar heights.
