Upstall is the easiest way to install NocoDB with SSL in under 2 minutes.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nocodb/nocodb/refs/heads/develop/docker-compose/1_Auto_Upstall/noco.sh' | bash -s
```

This script automatically installs:

- 📦 Docker
* 🚀 NocoDB
* 🐘 PostgreSQL
* ⚡ Redis
* 🗄 Minio (S3-compatible)
* 🌐 nginx (reverse proxy)
* 🔒 SSL certificates (auto-renewed)

After installation you can then visit your nocodb instance at http://your-domain.com

> Make sure your domain’s DNS points to the server where you are running Upstall.

## Prerequisites

* A Linux server (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
* A domain pointing to your server
* Port 80 and 443 open

## Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Update DNS settings**
   Point your domain (e.g. `nocodb.yourdomain.com`) to your server's public IP.


2. **SSH into your server**

   ```bash
   ssh user@your-server-ip
   ```

3. **Run the Upstall install script**

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nocodb/nocodb/refs/heads/develop/docker-compose/1_Auto_Upstall/noco.sh' | bash -s
   ```

4. **Access NocoDB**
   Open your browser at `http://your-domain.com`.

> if your NocoDB instance is not immediately accessible wait few minutes for DNS propagation

## Service Management Menu

After installation, a menu is provided to manage your NocoDB instance:

* Start NocoDB
* Stop NocoDB
* View logs
* Restart NocoDB
* Monitor NocoDB
* Update NocoDB
* Delete NocoDB

> Backups are not automated. Make sure to manually back up your PostgreSQL or file data if needed.

## Troubleshooting

* **Ports not accessible?** Check firewall settings and make sure port 80 and 443 are open.
* **SSL not working?** Double-check DNS and ensure the domain resolves correctly.
* **Re-run script?** It's idempotent and safe to re-run if needed.
