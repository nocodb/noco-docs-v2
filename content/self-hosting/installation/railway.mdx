[Railway](https://railway.app) is a developer-friendly platform that lets you launch full-stack applications with minimal configuration. NocoDB can be deployed on Railway using a prebuilt template, making it easy to get started.

## Step 1: Sign Up for Railway

If you‚Äôre new to Railway, head over to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and create an account. You can sign in using GitHub, GitLab, or an email address.

## Step 2: Start a New Project

1. Once logged in, click **‚ÄúNew Project.‚Äù**
2. In the template search bar, type **‚ÄúNocoDB‚Äù**.
3. Select the **NocoDB** template.
4. Review the configuration, then click **Deploy Project**.

Railway will automatically provision and start the necessary services (like the container and database).

## Step 3: Access Your NocoDB Instance

After deployment:

* Go to your Railway dashboard.
* Click on the NocoDB service.
* Open the generated URL (usually something like `your-project-name.up.railway.app`) to start using NocoDB.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Requirement Notice

The Railway **Trial plan** includes only 512 MB of RAM, which is not sufficient to run NocoDB even in minimal mode.

To run NocoDB reliably:

* Upgrade to the **Hobby plan** or higher.
* Plans with at least **1 GB RAM** are recommended for stable performance.

## Important Notes
- Make sure to configure environment variables for database connections if needed.
- Set up persistent storage or S3 for your NocoDB data.
- Regularly update your NocoDB instance for the latest features and security patches.

## You're Live üéâ

That‚Äôs it! NocoDB should now be running on Railway. You can begin creating APIs from your database, importing spreadsheets, or managing data collaboratively.
