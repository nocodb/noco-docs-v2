Render offers a simple way to host containerized applications with automatic HTTPS, scaling, and persistent storage. You can deploy **NocoDB** as a Web Service using Docker with just a few steps.

## Using the Deploy Button
You can easily deploy NocoDB to Render using the Deploy to Render button.

## Manual Deployment

> ⚠️ For optimal performance, we recommend using the \$25/month "Standard" service on Render.

1. Log into your [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com).
2. Click **New → Web Service** to begin creating a new app.
3. Choose **Existing Image**.
4. Use the official NocoDB image:

   ```
   Image URL: nocodb/nocodb
   ```
4. Click Connect

### Configure Persistent Storage

To ensure that your data survives service restarts or deployments, you must add a **volume mount**.

1. Under the **Advanced -> Disks** section of the service configuration:

   * Click **Add Disk**.
   * Name the disk (e.g., `nocodb-data`).
   * Set the **mount path** to:

     ```
     /usr/app/data
     ```
   * Choose an appropriate disk size (e.g., 1–5 GB for smaller projects, or more for production).

> 💡 NocoDB image stores its Postgres database, and data in this path by default, so mounting a volume here is essential for data persistence.


## Set Environment Variables

You may add any custom configuration through environment variables in the **Environment** tab (e.g., SMTP settings or external storage). the following env variables should be configured in production.

- NC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET
- NC_PUBLIC_URL

## Final Steps

1. Click **Create Web Service** to deploy.
2. Once the build finishes, your NocoDB instance will be live at the Render-generated URL.

You can now access the web UI, import your data, and start building APIs.

## Notes & Best Practices

* ✅ Mounting a volume at `/usr/app/data` is required to prevent data loss across restarts.
* 🔐 Enable HTTPS by default with Render’s built-in certificate support.
