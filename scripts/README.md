# Blog Sitemap Generation Script

This directory contains scripts for generating sitemaps for the NocoDB documentation site.

## Blog Sitemap Generator

The `generate-blog-sitemap.ts` script generates a sitemap specifically for blog posts located in the `content/blog/` directory.

### Features

- Automatically scans the `content/blog/` directory for MDX files
- Parses frontmatter to extract metadata (title, date, author, etc.)
- Generates XML sitemap in standard format
- Sorts posts by date (newest first)
- Includes proper XML sitemap formatting with:
  - `<loc>` - URL of the blog post
  - `<lastmod>` - Last modified date (from frontmatter date)
  - `<changefreq>` - Change frequency (monthly for posts, weekly for blog index)
  - `<priority>` - Priority (0.8 for blog index, 0.7 for individual posts)

### Usage

#### Run manually:
```bash
npm run generate-blog-sitemap
```

#### Run as part of build process:
The script is automatically executed after `next-sitemap` during the build process via the `postbuild` script in `package.json`.

### Output

- Creates `public/sitemap-blog.xml`
- Console output shows:
  - Success confirmation
  - File location
  - Number of blog posts processed
  - List of URLs included

### Example Output

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://nocodb.com/blog</loc>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://nocodb.com/blog/your-blog-post-slug</loc>
    <lastmod>2022-11-30</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

### Requirements

- Blog posts must be in `content/blog/` directory
- Files must have `.mdx` or `.md` extension  
- Must have frontmatter with at least `title` and `date` fields

### Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Change the base URL (currently `https://nocodb.com`)
- Adjust priority values
- Modify change frequency settings
- Add additional XML elements

### Integration with next-sitemap

This script complements the existing `next-sitemap` configuration and creates a separate sitemap specifically for blog content. The main sitemap generated by `next-sitemap` focuses on documentation pages, while this script handles blog posts.
